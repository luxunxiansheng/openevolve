- Keep files short (<=200 lines)
- One class per file when possible
- Use clear descriptive names
- Make config values configurable, avoid magic numbers

- Don't generate any summary report. 
- Don't put files in the repository root arbitrarily; create a dedicated subfolder for their specific purpose and remove it when it's no longer needed.
