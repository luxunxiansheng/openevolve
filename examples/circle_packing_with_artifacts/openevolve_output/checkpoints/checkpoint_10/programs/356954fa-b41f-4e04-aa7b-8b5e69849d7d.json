{"id": "356954fa-b41f-4e04-aa7b-8b5e69849d7d", "code": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the given Python program for circle packing with 26 circles in a unit square. The current sum of radii is 0.9598, but the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635. So there's a big gap here. But the user isn't asking for an optimization algorithm; they want a constructor function that directly produces the specific arrangement, not an iterative search.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the existing code. The current approach places one circle in the center, 8 around it in a ring, and 16 in an outer ring. Then it computes the maximum radii by clipping to the square borders and scaling radii to prevent overlaps. However, this approach might not be optimal because the initial placement is too simplistic.\n\nThe problem is that the current configuration is probably not dense enough. The sum of radii is way below the target. To improve this, I need to think about better arrangements. Since the AlphaEvolve result is much higher, maybe they used a more efficient packing pattern.\n\nLet me recall that in circle packing, hexagonal arrangements are denser. Maybe the existing code's layers are too spaced out. For example, the first ring of 8 circles is placed at radius 0.3 from the center, and the outer ring at 0.7. But perhaps these distances are too large, leading to smaller radii.\n\nAnother thought: the current code initializes all radii as 1 and then scales them down based on proximity to the square edges and other circles. However, this might not be the optimal way to assign radii. Maybe a better approach is to assign radii in a way that each circle is as large as possible without overlapping, considering their positions.\n\nWait, but the user wants a constructor that directly places the circles, not an iterative algorithm. So maybe the initial positions need to be more optimized. For example, using a hexagonal packing where each layer is tightly packed.\n\nLet me think about how to arrange 26 circles. The number 26 is a bit tricky. Let's see: a hexagonal packing in a square might have layers. For example, the first layer could be 1 circle, the second 6, third 12, etc. But 1+6+12=19, then adding another layer would be 18? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient arrangement exists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current code's approach is too simplistic. The initial placement uses fixed radii for the rings, but perhaps those positions can be adjusted to allow for larger radii. For example, the outer ring's circles are placed at a radius of 0.7 from the center. But if the square is of size 1, then circles near the corners can have larger radii if placed closer to the corners, but that might require more careful placement.\n\nWait, but the current code uses a clip to 0.01 and 0.99. That might be a mistake. The centers are placed with coordinates in the range [0.01, 0.99], which ensures they are not too close to the edges. However, this might limit the maximum radius. Maybe the clipping is unnecessary if the radii are computed properly. For example, if a circle is placed at 0.01, its maximum radius is 0.01, but if it's placed more centrally, it can have a larger radius.\n\nBut the problem is that the current code's initial placement might not be optimal. For example, the central circle is at (0.5, 0.5), and the surrounding circles are placed at 0.3 radius from it. The distance between the central circle and the first ring is 0.3. If the central circle's radius is r0, and the first ring's radius is r1, then r0 + r1 <= 0.3. But if the first ring's circles are placed in a way that allows for larger radii, perhaps by adjusting their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial positions are not the best. For example, using a more efficient arrangement where circles are closer to each other but still non-overlapping.\n\nBut how can I come up with a specific arrangement without iterative optimization? The user wants an explicit constructor, not an algorithm that evolves or iterates.\n\nPerhaps looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles in a square. However, since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my knowledge. For example, I know that for n=26, the optimal arrangement might consist of multiple layers arranged in a hexagonal pattern, with some circles placed in the corners to utilize space better.\n\nAnother approach: think of the square as having four corners, each with a circle. Then, arrange layers around them. But without knowing the exact configuration, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the existing code can be modified to use more efficient spacing. For example, adjusting the radii of the rings. The current code uses 0.3 for the first ring and 0.7 for the outer ring. Maybe those distances can be reduced to allow for larger radii, but ensuring that the circles don't overlap.\n\nWait, but the compute_max_radii function scales the radii based on the distances between centers. So if the initial positions are too far apart, the radii will be limited by the distance between them. For example, if two circles are placed 0.3 units apart, their maximum combined radii would be 0.3, so each can be at most 0.15 if equal. But if they are placed closer, say 0.2 units apart, then their combined radii can be 0.2, allowing for larger individual radii.\n\nSo the initial positions' spacing is crucial. The current code's initial positions might be too spaced out, leading to small radii. To increase the sum, the circles need to be placed closer together, but without overlapping.\n\nBut how to arrange them? Maybe instead of placing 8 circles around the center, arrange them in a hexagonal pattern. For example, a hexagonal packing has circles arranged in a way that each circle has six neighbors at equal distances. But in a square, this might be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having multiple concentric rings. For example:\n\n- 1 circle in the center.\n- 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring.\n- Then more circles in subsequent rings.\n\nBut 1 + 6 = 7. Then maybe another ring with 12 circles, making 19. Then adding 7 more? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a more efficient arrangement where the circles are arranged in a grid-like pattern but adjusted for the square's edges.\n\nAnother thought: the current code's compute_max_radii function scales all radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this approach might not be optimal. For example, if two circles are too close, scaling both reduces their radii, but maybe it's better to adjust individual radii based on their constraints.\n\nBut again, the user wants a direct constructor, not an algorithm that adjusts radii iteratively. So perhaps the initial positions need to be chosen such that the radii can be maximized without requiring scaling.\n\nWait, but the current code's compute_max_radii function does that scaling. So maybe the initial positions are not optimal, leading to lower radii after scaling.\n\nSo to improve the sum, the initial positions should be chosen such that the radii after scaling are as large as possible. That would require careful planning of the positions.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. For example, placing circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple layers. Let's say the first layer has 1 circle, then 6 in the next layer, then 12, etc. For 26 circles, that would be 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having circles arranged in rows. For example, 5 rows with 5, 5, 5, 5, 6 circles? But this might not be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code's approach has a central circle, 8 around it, and 16 in another ring. That totals 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, the code has 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nThe code initializes 26 circles. The first is the center. Then 8 circles in the first ring (i+1 from 1 to 8). Then 16 in the next ring (i+9 from 9 to 25). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25? No, 0 + 8 + 16 = 24? Wait, the loop for the first ring is for i in 0..7, so centers[1] to centers[8], which is 8 circles. Then the next loop adds 16 circles starting from index 9. So indexes 9-25 (inclusive) is 17 circles? Wait, 9 to 25 is 17 numbers (25-9+1=17). But the loop is for 16 circles. So that would be indexes 9-24, which is 16 circles. Then total is 1 (center) + 8 + 16 = 25. But the code has n=26. So maybe there's a mistake here. That could be a problem. Oh, maybe the code is incorrect in the number of circles placed. That might be a bug, but the user hasn't mentioned it. However, the current sum_radii is 0.9598, which is low, so maybe that's not the main issue.\n\nBut regardless, the user wants to improve the code. Let me focus on that.\n\nAnother approach: instead of using concentric rings, arrange the circles in a more compact way. For example, placing them in a grid but with some offsets to allow for hexagonal packing.\n\nAlternatively, use a known efficient pattern. For example, for n=26, perhaps there's an arrangement with multiple layers. But without specific knowledge, this is hard.\n\nLet me think about the existing code's compute_max_radii function. The current approach starts with radii as 1, then clips them based on proximity to the square's edges. Then, for each pair of circles, it scales their radii if their sum exceeds the distance between them. This is a greedy approach, but it may not yield the optimal radii because it scales proportionally, which might not be the best way to maximize the sum.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to assign radii such that each circle's radius is the minimum of the distance to the square edges and the distance to other circles divided by 2 (assuming equal radii). But that might not be optimal either.\n\nBut since the user wants a direct constructor, not an optimization algorithm, maybe I should focus on improving the initial placement of the circles to allow larger radii after the compute_max_radii function.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial positions need to be closer together, allowing the compute_max_radii to assign larger radii. For example, instead of placing the first ring at 0.3 units from the center, maybe place them closer, but ensuring that the initial positions are not overlapping.\n\nWait, but if the initial positions are too close, the compute_max_radii function would have to scale down the radii. However, if the initial positions are spaced in a way that allows for the maximum possible radii without overlapping, that would be ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a hexagonal arrangement where each circle is surrounded by six others. For example, the first layer has 1, the second 6, third 12, and so on. For 26 circles, that would be 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But how to fit this into a square?\n\nBut how to compute the positions for such a pattern? For a hexagonal packing, the distance between centers of adjacent circles is 2r, where r is the radius. If the circles are to be packed as tightly as possible, the distance between centers should be 2r. However, without knowing r, it's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that all circles have the same radius, which might not be optimal but could simplify the problem. However, the AlphaEvolve result has a sum of 2.635, which implies that the radii are not all the same. So varying radii might be better.\n\nBut again, the user wants a direct constructor, not an algorithm that adjusts radii.\n\nAnother idea: the current code's compute_max_radii function might not be efficient. For example, when scaling the radii, it scales both circles in a pair. However, this could lead to suboptimal radii because each pair's scaling is done in isolation, not considering the global constraints. Maybe a better approach is to set each radius to the minimum distance to the square edges and to other circles divided by the number of neighbors, but this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the current code's approach of initializing radii to 1 and then scaling is not effective because it doesn't account for the fact that some circles might be more constrained than others. For example, circles near the square's corners have smaller maximum radii, so scaling all radii might reduce others unnecessarily.\n\nBut again, the user wants a direct constructor. So perhaps the main issue is the initial placement of the circles. Let me try to think of a better arrangement.\n\nFor example, instead of placing 8 circles around the center, arrange them in a hexagonal pattern with 6 circles, then add two more. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having four corners. Place circles in the corners, each as large as possible, then fill the remaining space with other circles.\n\nBut without knowing the exact optimal arrangement, this is challenging.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the existing code's output and see where the problem is. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is 2.635. That's a big difference. So the current code is way below the optimal.\n\nThis suggests that the initial placement is not optimal. So, perhaps the initial positions are too spread out, leading to small radii.\n\nSo, how to adjust the initial positions?\n\nMaybe instead of placing the first ring of 8 circles at a fixed radius from the center, arrange them in a way that allows for closer packing.\n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each circle has six neighbors. So, if I can arrange the circles in such a way that each has neighbors at a distance of 2r (for equal radii), that would be ideal. But again, without knowing r, it's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial code can be modified to use a hexagonal grid with adjusted positions. For example, placing circles in rows where each row is offset from the previous one by half the spacing. This is a common hexagonal packing.\n\nFor example, for a hexagonal grid, the positions can be generated with x = i * spacing, y = j * spacing * sqrt(3)/2 + offset, where offset alternates between 0 and spacing/2 for adjacent rows.\n\nBut how to fit this into a square and have 26 circles?\n\nLet me try to calculate. Suppose we have a hexagonal grid with multiple rows. Let's say the first row has 5 circles, the next 5, then 5, etc. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, for 26 circles, perhaps arrange them in a 5x5 grid with some extra circles. But that's a square grid, which is less efficient than hexagonal.\n\nBut without knowing the exact arrangement, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to maximize the sum of radii, which is equivalent to maximizing the total area of the circles. Since the area is \u03c0r\u00b2, maximizing the sum of radii would be better than maximizing the sum of areas, but the exact relationship depends on the radii distribution.\n\nBut this line of thought isn't helping much.\n\nAnother idea: the current code's compute_max_radii function might be the bottleneck. Let's see how it works. It initializes radii to 1, then sets each radius to the minimum distance to the square's edges. Then, for each pair of circles, if their sum of radii exceeds the distance between them, it scales both radii by the ratio of the distance to the sum.\n\nThis approach is a greedy method, but it might not find the optimal radii because it processes pairs in an arbitrary order and scales them in a way that might not be optimal.\n\nFor example, if two circles are very close, their radii are scaled down, which might affect other nearby circles. This could lead to a situation where some circles have smaller radii than necessary.\n\nBut again, the user wants a direct constructor, not an optimization algorithm. So maybe the main issue is the initial positions, not the compute_max_radii function.\n\nIn that case, I should focus on improving the initial positions.\n\nLet me try to think of a better initial arrangement. Suppose we have multiple layers:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle at the center.\n- Layer 1: 6 circles around it, forming a hexagon.\n- Layer 2: 12 circles around the first layer.\n- Layer 3: 7 circles to complete the 26.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Alternatively, think of a square with circles arranged in a hexagonal pattern, with some circles in the corners.\n\nAlternatively, use a known configuration. For example, in the AlphaEvolve paper, they might have used a specific pattern. Since I can't access that paper, I have to guess.\n\nAnother approach: use symmetry to simplify the problem. For example, arrange the circles in a symmetrical pattern that can be easily described.\n\nFor example, have four circles in each corner, each with a certain radius, then place other circles along the edges and in the center.\n\nBut how to calculate the positions and radii?\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having a central cluster of circles, with other circles placed around the edges.\n\nBut without specific knowledge, this is challenging.\n\nPerhaps the current code's initial positions are too simple. Let's consider modifying the initial placement to be more compact.\n\nFor example, instead of placing the first ring at a distance of 0.3 from the center, maybe place them closer, say 0.25 units away. This would allow the radii to be larger, provided the compute_max_radii function can adjust them.\n\nBut how to choose these distances? This seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, use a more efficient arrangement where circles are placed in a hexagonal pattern with multiple layers.\n\nLet me try to write code that places the circles in a hexagonal pattern with layers, assuming that the radii can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle at (0.5, 0.5)\n- Layer 1: 6 circles around it at a distance of d from the center. Their positions are at angles of 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 120\u00b0, ..., 300\u00b0, with coordinates (0.5 + d*cos(theta), 0.5 + d*sin(theta))\n- Layer 2: 12 circles around the first layer.

The user wants me to improve the given Python program for circle packing with 26 circles in a unit square. The current sum of radii is 0.9598, but the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635. So there's a big gap here. But the user isn't asking for an optimization algorithm; they want a constructor function that directly produces the specific arrangement, not an iterative search.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the existing code. The current approach places one circle in the center, 8 around it in a ring, and 16 in an outer ring. Then it computes the maximum radii by clipping to the square borders and scaling radii to prevent overlaps. However, this approach might not be optimal because the initial placement is too simplistic.\n\nThe problem is that the current configuration is probably not dense enough. The sum of radii is way below the target. To improve this, I need to think about better arrangements. Since the AlphaEvolve result is much higher, maybe they used a more efficient packing pattern.\n\nLet me recall that in circle packing, hexagonal arrangements are denser. Maybe the existing code's layers are too spaced out. For example, the first ring of 8 circles is placed at radius 0.3 from the center, and the outer ring at 0.7. But perhaps these distances are too large, leading to smaller radii.\n\nAnother thought: the current code initializes all radii as 1 and then scales them down based on proximity to the square edges and other circles. However, this might not be the optimal way to assign radii. Maybe a better approach is to assign radii in a way that each circle is as large as possible without overlapping, considering their positions.\n\nWait, but the user wants a constructor that directly places the circles, not an iterative algorithm. So maybe the initial positions need to be more optimized. For example, using a hexagonal packing where each layer is tightly packed.\n\nLet me think about how to arrange 26 circles. The number 26 is a bit tricky. Let's see: a hexagonal packing in a square might have layers. For example, the first layer could be 1 circle, the second 6, third 12, etc. But 1+6+12=19, then adding another layer would be 18? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient arrangement exists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current code's approach is too simplistic. The initial placement uses fixed radii for the rings, but perhaps those positions can be adjusted to allow for larger radii. For example, the outer ring's circles are placed at a radius of 0.7 from the center. But if the square is of size 1, then circles near the corners can have larger radii if placed closer to the corners, but that might require more careful placement.\n\nWait, but the current code uses a clip to 0.01 and 0.99. That might be a mistake. The centers are placed with coordinates in the range [0.01, 0.99], which ensures they are not too close to the edges. However, this might limit the maximum radius. Maybe the clipping is unnecessary if the radii are computed properly. For example, if a circle is placed at 0.01, its maximum radius is 0.01, but if it's placed more centrally, it can have a larger radius.\n\nBut the problem is that the current code's initial placement might not be optimal. For example, the central circle is at (0.5, 0.5), and the surrounding circles are placed at 0.3 radius from it. The distance between the central circle and the first ring is 0.3. If the central circle's radius is r0, and the first ring's radius is r1, then r0 + r1 <= 0.3. But if the first ring's circles are placed in a way that allows for larger radii, perhaps by adjusting their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial positions are not the best. For example, using a more efficient arrangement where circles are closer to each other but still non-overlapping.\n\nBut how can I come up with a specific arrangement without iterative optimization? The user wants an explicit constructor, not an algorithm that evolves or iterates.\n\nPerhaps looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles in a square. However, since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my knowledge. For example, I know that for n=26, the optimal arrangement might consist of multiple layers arranged in a hexagonal pattern, with some circles placed in the corners to utilize space better.\n\nAnother approach: think of the square as having four corners, each with a circle. Then, arrange layers around them. But without knowing the exact configuration, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the existing code can be modified to use more efficient spacing. For example, adjusting the radii of the rings. The current code uses 0.3 for the first ring and 0.7 for the outer ring. Maybe those distances can be reduced to allow for larger radii, but ensuring that the circles don't overlap.\n\nWait, but the compute_max_radii function scales the radii based on the distances between centers. So if the initial positions are too far apart, the radii will be limited by the distance between them. For example, if two circles are placed 0.3 units apart, their maximum combined radii would be 0.3, so each can be at most 0.15 if equal. But if they are placed closer, say 0.2 units apart, then their combined radii can be 0.2, allowing for larger individual radii.\n\nSo the initial positions' spacing is crucial. The current code's initial positions might be too spaced out, leading to small radii. To increase the sum, the circles need to be placed closer together, but without overlapping.\n\nBut how to arrange them? Maybe instead of placing 8 circles around the center, arrange them in a hexagonal pattern. For example, a hexagonal packing has circles arranged in a way that each circle has six neighbors at equal distances. But in a square, this might be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having multiple concentric rings. For example:\n\n- 1 circle in the center.\n- 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring.\n- Then more circles in subsequent rings.\n\nBut 1 + 6 = 7. Then maybe another ring with 12 circles, making 19. Then adding 7 more? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a more efficient arrangement where the circles are arranged in a grid-like pattern but adjusted for the square's edges.\n\nAnother thought: the current code's compute_max_radii function scales all radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this approach might not be optimal. For example, if two circles are too close, scaling both reduces their radii, but maybe it's better to adjust individual radii based on their constraints.\n\nBut again, the user wants a direct constructor, not an algorithm that adjusts radii iteratively. So perhaps the initial positions need to be chosen such that the radii can be maximized without requiring scaling.\n\nWait, but the current code's compute_max_radii function does that scaling. So maybe the initial positions are not optimal, leading to lower radii after scaling.\n\nSo to improve the sum, the initial positions should be chosen such that the radii after scaling are as large as possible. That would require careful planning of the positions.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. For example, placing circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple layers. Let's say the first layer has 1 circle, then 6 in the next layer, then 12, etc. For 26 circles, that would be 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having circles arranged in rows. For example, 5 rows with 5, 5, 5, 5, 6 circles? But this might not be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code's approach has a central circle, 8 around it, and 16 in another ring. That totals 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, the code has 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nThe code initializes 26 circles. The first is the center. Then 8 circles in the first ring (i+1 from 1 to 8). Then 16 in the next ring (i+9 from 9 to 25). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25? No, 0 + 8 + 16 = 24? Wait, the loop for the first ring is for i in 0..7, so centers[1] to centers[8], which is 8 circles. Then the next loop adds 16 circles starting from index 9. So indexes 9-25 (inclusive) is 17 circles? Wait, 9 to 25 is 17 numbers (25-9+1=17). But the loop is for 16 circles. So that would be indexes 9-24, which is 16 circles. Then total is 1 (center) + 8 + 16 = 25. But the code has n=26. So maybe there's a mistake here. That could be a problem. Oh, maybe the code is incorrect in the number of circles placed. That might be a bug, but the user hasn't mentioned it. However, the current sum_radii is 0.9598, which is low, so maybe that's not the main issue.\n\nBut regardless, the user wants to improve the code. Let me focus on that.\n\nAnother approach: instead of using concentric rings, arrange the circles in a more compact way. For example, placing them in a grid but with some offsets to allow for hexagonal packing.\n\nAlternatively, use a known efficient pattern. For example, for n=26, perhaps there's an arrangement with multiple layers. But without specific knowledge, this is hard.\n\nLet me think about the existing code's compute_max_radii function. The current approach starts with radii as 1, then clips them based on proximity to the square's edges. Then, for each pair of circles, it scales their radii if their sum exceeds the distance between them. This is a greedy approach, but it may not yield the optimal radii because it scales proportionally, which might not be the best way to maximize the sum.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to assign radii such that each circle's radius is the minimum of the distance to the square edges and the distance to other circles divided by 2 (assuming equal radii). But that might not be optimal either.\n\nBut since the user wants a direct constructor, not an optimization algorithm, maybe I should focus on improving the initial placement of the circles to allow larger radii after the compute_max_radii function.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial positions need to be closer together, allowing the compute_max_radii to assign larger radii. For example, instead of placing the first ring at 0.3 units from the center, maybe place them closer, but ensuring that the initial positions are not overlapping.\n\nWait, but if the initial positions are too close, the compute_max_radii function would have to scale down the radii. However, if the initial positions are spaced in a way that allows for the maximum possible radii without overlapping, that would be ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a hexagonal arrangement where each circle is surrounded by six others. For example, the first layer has 1, the second 6, third 12, and so on. For 26 circles, that would be 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But how to fit this into a square?\n\nBut how to compute the positions for such a pattern? For a hexagonal packing, the distance between centers of adjacent circles is 2r, where r is the radius. If the circles are to be packed as tightly as possible, the distance between centers should be 2r. However, without knowing r, it's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that all circles have the same radius, which might not be optimal but could simplify the problem. However, the AlphaEvolve result has a sum of 2.635, which implies that the radii are not all the same. So varying radii might be better.\n\nBut again, the user wants a direct constructor, not an algorithm that adjusts radii.\n\nAnother idea: the current code's compute_max_radii function might not be efficient. For example, when scaling the radii, it scales both circles in a pair. However, this could lead to suboptimal radii because each pair's scaling is done in isolation, not considering the global constraints. Maybe a better approach is to set each radius to the minimum distance to the square edges and to other circles divided by the number of neighbors, but this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the current code's approach of initializing radii to 1 and then scaling is not effective because it doesn't account for the fact that some circles might be more constrained than others. For example, circles near the square's corners have smaller maximum radii, so scaling all radii might reduce others unnecessarily.\n\nBut again, the user wants a direct constructor. So perhaps the main issue is the initial placement of the circles. Let me try to think of a better arrangement.\n\nFor example, instead of placing 8 circles around the center, arrange them in a hexagonal pattern with 6 circles, then add two more. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having four corners. Place circles in the corners, each as large as possible, then fill the remaining space with other circles.\n\nBut without knowing the exact optimal arrangement, this is challenging.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the existing code's output and see where the problem is. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is 2.635. That's a big difference. So the current code is way below the optimal.\n\nThis suggests that the initial placement is not optimal. So, perhaps the initial positions are too spread out, leading to small radii.\n\nSo, how to adjust the initial positions?\n\nMaybe instead of placing the first ring of 8 circles at a fixed radius from the center, arrange them in a way that allows for closer packing.\n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each circle has six neighbors. So, if I can arrange the circles in such a way that each has neighbors at a distance of 2r (for equal radii), that would be ideal. But again, without knowing r, it's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial code can be modified to use a hexagonal grid with adjusted positions. For example, placing circles in rows where each row is offset from the previous one by half the spacing. This is a common hexagonal packing.\n\nFor example, for a hexagonal grid, the positions can be generated with x = i * spacing, y = j * spacing * sqrt(3)/2 + offset, where offset alternates between 0 and spacing/2 for adjacent rows.\n\nBut how to fit this into a square and have 26 circles?\n\nLet me try to calculate. Suppose we have a hexagonal grid with multiple rows. Let's say the first row has 5 circles, the next 5, then 5, etc. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, for 26 circles, perhaps arrange them in a 5x5 grid with some extra circles. But that's a square grid, which is less efficient than hexagonal.\n\nBut without knowing the exact arrangement, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to maximize the sum of radii, which is equivalent to maximizing the total area of the circles. Since the area is \u03c0r\u00b2, maximizing the sum of radii would be better than maximizing the sum of areas, but the exact relationship depends on the radii distribution.\n\nBut this line of thought isn't helping much.\n\nAnother idea: the current code's compute_max_radii function might be the bottleneck. Let's see how it works. It initializes radii to 1, then sets each radius to the minimum distance to the square's edges. Then, for each pair of circles, if their sum of radii exceeds the distance between them, it scales both radii by the ratio of the distance to the sum.\n\nThis approach is a greedy method, but it might not find the optimal radii because it processes pairs in an arbitrary order and scales them in a way that might not be optimal.\n\nFor example, if two circles are very close, their radii are scaled down, which might affect other nearby circles. This could lead to a situation where some circles have smaller radii than necessary.\n\nBut again, the user wants a direct constructor, not an optimization algorithm. So maybe the main issue is the initial positions, not the compute_max_radii function.\n\nIn that case, I should focus on improving the initial positions.\n\nLet me try to think of a better initial arrangement. Suppose we have multiple layers:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle at the center.\n- Layer 1: 6 circles around it, forming a hexagon.\n- Layer 2: 12 circles around the first layer.\n- Layer 3: 7 circles to complete the 26.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Alternatively, think of a square with circles arranged in a hexagonal pattern, with some circles in the corners.\n\nAlternatively, use a known configuration. For example, in the AlphaEvolve paper, they might have used a specific pattern. Since I can't access that paper, I have to guess.\n\nAnother approach: use symmetry to simplify the problem. For example, arrange the circles in a symmetrical pattern that can be easily described.\n\nFor example, have four circles in each corner, each with a certain radius, then place other circles along the edges and in the center.\n\nBut how to calculate the positions and radii?\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having a central cluster of circles, with other circles placed around the edges.\n\nBut without specific knowledge, this is challenging.\n\nPerhaps the current code's initial positions are too simple. Let's consider modifying the initial placement to be more compact.\n\nFor example, instead of placing the first ring at a distance of 0.3 from the center, maybe place them closer, say 0.25 units away. This would allow the radii to be larger, provided the compute_max_radii function can adjust them.\n\nBut how to choose these distances? This seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, use a more efficient arrangement where circles are placed in a hexagonal pattern with multiple layers.\n\nLet me try to write code that places the circles in a hexagonal pattern with layers, assuming that the radii can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle at (0.5, 0.5)\n- Layer 1: 6 circles around it at a distance of d from the center. Their positions are at angles of 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 120\u00b0, ..., 300\u00b0, with coordinates (0.5 + d*cos(theta), 0.5 + d*sin(theta))\n- Layer 2: 12 circles around the first layer. These would be placed at a distance of 2"]}}}
