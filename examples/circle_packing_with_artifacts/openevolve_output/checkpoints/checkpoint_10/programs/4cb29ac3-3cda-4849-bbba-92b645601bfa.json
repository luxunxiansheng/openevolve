{"id": "4cb29ac3-3cda-4849-bbba-92b645601bfa", "code": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the circle packing program for 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of radii. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is around 2.635 as mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper. So there's a big gap here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the current approach isn't achieving that. The existing code places a central circle, then 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But maybe this arrangement isn't optimal. The problem is that the current method uses a simple radial placement, which might not utilize space efficiently, especially near the edges.\n\nThe key insights from the user's notes are about hexagonal packing, edge effects, and varying radii. So maybe a more efficient pattern, like a hexagonal grid, would help. But with 26 circles, how to arrange them? Let's think about typical circle packing arrangements. \n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each layer adds more circles. Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii. Maybe adjusting the clipping or the initial positions can help.\n\nAlso, the compute_max_radii function scales radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this is a greedy approach and might not find the optimal radii. Maybe there's a better way to compute the radii, perhaps using a more systematic method like solving a system of equations for the constraints, but that might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but the user wants an explicit constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598. So maybe that error isn't the main issue here, but it's a bug that needs fixing. So in the new code, I need to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct the circle placement. Let me think of a better arrangement.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid with some layers. For example, arrange circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple rows. For 26 circles, maybe 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. But I need to think of a way to place them.\n\nAlternatively, look at the standard circle packing in a square. For example, for n=26, there might be a known configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of an arrangement that can be constructed manually.\n\nLet me consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at 0.7 radius from the center. That might be too close to the edges. For example, if the center is at 0.5, then adding 0.7 in x direction would take it to 1.2, but then the code clips it to 0.99, which reduces the radius. So maybe the initial positions are not optimal.\n\nAnother idea: use a more efficient arrangement where circles are placed closer to the edges, allowing for larger radii. For example, having circles along the edges, but arranged in a way that they can have larger radii without overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, using a combination of different layers. Maybe a central circle, then a ring around it with 6 circles, then another ring with 12, and so on. Let's see:\n\n- 1 + 6 = 7\n- 1 + 6 + 12 = 19\n- 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 = 37, which is more than 26. So for 26, maybe 1 + 6 + 12 + 7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a square arrangement with some circles in the corners and along the edges. For example, place circles in the four corners, then along the edges, and then in the center.\n\nBut I need to think of a way to place all 26 circles with as much symmetry as possible to maximize the sum of radii.\n\nAlternatively, look at the existing code's structure. It has a central circle, 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But 8 around a central circle is a square ring, which is less dense than a hexagonal ring. Maybe changing the 8 to 6, and adding more layers.\n\nWait, the current code has 8 circles around the center. That would form a square ring, which is not the densest possible. A hexagonal ring would have 6 circles. But then, the code is using 8, which might be leading to suboptimal packing.\n\nSo perhaps changing the initial arrangement to use a hexagonal pattern. For example:\n\n- 1 center circle.\n- 6 circles in a hexagonal ring around it.\n- Then another ring with 12 circles, but that would be 19 circles. Then, adding 7 more circles in some way.\n\nBut how to place them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current approach of using a central circle with two rings is not the best. Let me think of a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: use a grid of circles arranged in rows and columns, but with offsets to form a hexagonal pattern. For example, for 26 circles, arrange them in a 5x5 grid, but with some adjustments. However, that's 25 circles. Adding one more in a corner.\n\nBut the problem is that a square grid is less efficient than a hexagonal grid. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 26 circles as 3 layers: center, 6 in the first ring, 12 in the second ring, and 7 in a third ring. But that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the initial code has a mistake in the number of circles. Let me check again:\n\nIn the code:\n\ncenters[0] = [0.5, 0.5]\n\nThen for i in range(8):\n\ncenters[i+1] = ... \u2192 indexes 1 to 8 (8 circles)\n\nThen for i in range(16):\n\ncenters[i+9] = ... \u2192 indexes 9 to 24 (16 circles)\n\nSo that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles. The 26th is not placed. So that's a bug. So the code is not initializing all 26 circles. That would definitely be a problem. So the user's current code is incorrect. So that's one thing to fix.\n\nSo, the first step is to ensure that all 26 circles are placed. Then, adjust their positions for better packing.\n\nSo, the revised code should place all 26 circles properly.\n\nNow, considering that, perhaps the initial arrangement can be improved.\n\nLet me think of a possible better arrangement. For example, using a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let's say:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle (center)\n- Layer 1: 6 circles around it (hexagonal ring)\n- Layer 2: 12 circles around that (another hexagonal ring)\n- Total so far: 1 + 6 + 12 = 19 circles\n- Then, for the remaining 7 circles, maybe place them in a partial ring or adjust positions.\n\nAlternatively, for 26 circles, maybe 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But how to place those 7?\n\nAlternatively, use a different approach. Maybe a square with circles in the corners and along the edges, and then fill the center.\n\nBut I need to think of a way to construct this.\n\nAnother approach: look at the AlphaEvolve paper's method. Since the user mentioned that AlphaEvolve achieved 2.635, which is much higher than the current 0.9598, the current code must have a significant flaw. The current sum is way too low, which suggests that the initial positions are not optimal, leading to very small radii due to proximity to edges or overlaps.\n\nSo, the problem is that the initial positions are not optimal. Therefore, the key is to find a better arrangement of circles that allows for larger radii without overlapping and staying within the square.\n\nLet me think of a better initial placement. For example, placing circles closer to the edges but arranged in a way that their radii can be larger. For example, placing circles along the edges with some spacing, and then filling the center area with more circles.\n\nBut how to balance that?\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at 0.7 units from the center. But if the square is of size 1, then the maximum distance from the center to the edge is 0.5. Wait, no. The center is at (0.5, 0.5), and the maximum distance to the edge is 0.5 in any direction. So placing circles at 0.7 units from the center would take them beyond the square's edge. But the code clips them to 0.99, which is 0.49 units away from the edge. Therefore, those outer circles are placed very close to the edge, which limits their radii.\n\nSo perhaps the initial placement of the outer ring is too far from the center, leading to clipping and small radii.\n\nTherefore, maybe adjusting the initial positions to be closer to the center, allowing for larger radii without clipping.\n\nFor example, instead of placing the outer ring at 0.7 units from the center, place them closer. Let's think about the maximum radius a circle can have in the square. If a circle is placed at (x, y), its maximum radius is the minimum of x, y, 1-x, 1-y. So to maximize the radius, the circle should be as far as possible from the edges.\n\nTherefore, placing circles in the center region would allow for larger radii. However, with 26 circles, it's a trade-off between packing density and proximity to the edges.\n\nSo maybe a better approach is to use a hexagonal grid in the center area, with circles placed in a way that they are as far from the edges as possible.\n\nAlternatively, think of dividing the square into regions. For example, place circles in a hexagonal pattern that fits within the square.\n\nBut without knowing the exact optimal configuration, I need to design an arrangement that is plausible.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose I arrange the circles in a hexagonal grid with multiple layers. For example:\n\n- 1 circle in the center.\n- 6 circles around it, each at a distance of r1 from the center.\n- 12 circles around those, at a distance of r2 from the center.\n- Then, adjust positions so that all circles are within the square and have as large a radius as possible.\n\nBut how to compute r1 and r2?\n\nAlternatively, use the following approach:\n\n- Place the circles in a hexagonal grid with certain spacing, ensuring that they are all within the square and that their radii are maximized based on their proximity to the edges and other circles.\n\nBut since this is a constructor function, I need to hardcode the positions.\n\nAnother idea: use a configuration similar to the known best for n=26. Since I can't look it up, but the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635, which is much higher than the current sum, the current arrangement is very suboptimal. So the initial positions are likely not good.\n\nLet me think of a different arrangement. For example, instead of one large circle in the center, use multiple circles arranged in a way that allows for larger total radii.\n\nMaybe a more even distribution of circles, avoiding having one large central circle that limits the size of surrounding circles.\n\nAlternatively, use a configuration where all circles have similar radii, arranged in a hexagonal pattern.\n\nBut how to arrange 26 circles in a hexagonal pattern within a square?\n\nLet me think of the number of circles per layer. For a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each concentric layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. So:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle (center)\n- Layer 1: 6 circles\n- Layer 2: 12 circles\n- Layer 3: 18 circles\n\nSo for 26 circles, that would be 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. So layer 0 (1), layer 1 (6), layer 2 (12), and then 7 circles in a partial layer.\n\nBut how to place them?\n\nAssuming the center is at (0.5, 0.5), the first layer (layer 1) would be placed at a distance d from the center. The second layer would be at 2d, and so on. But the exact positions depend on the spacing between circles.\n\nThe distance between centers of adjacent circles in a hexagonal packing is 2r, where r is the radius of the circles. However, since the radii may vary, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, assuming all circles have the same radius, which might not be optimal, but for simplicity. If all circles have the same radius, then the distance between centers of adjacent circles is 2r. However, the problem is that the edge circles will have a smaller radius due to proximity to the square's edges.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the sum of radii, perhaps varying radii would be better, allowing some circles to be larger if they are placed in the center, and smaller ones near the edges.\n\nBut without knowing the exact optimal configuration, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me try to construct a new arrangement.\n\nFirst, place 1 circle in the center: (0.5, 0.5). Let's call this circle 0.\n\nThen, place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring. The distance from the center to each of these circles should be such that they are not overlapping with the center circle. If the center circle has radius r0, then the distance between centers should be at least 2r0. Let's say the distance is 2r0. Then the 6 circles are placed at a distance of 2r0 from the center.\n\nBut since all circles will have varying radii, this approach might not work. Alternatively, assume that all circles have the same radius, r. Then, the distance between centers is 2r. The distance from the center to the edge of the square would be 0.5 - r (if the circle is at the edge of the square). But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the maximum possible radius for each circle based on their position. For example, the central circle can have a radius of up to 0.5 (since it's at the center, distance to the edge is 0.5). However, if other circles are placed around it, their proximity will limit the radius.\n\nBut this seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. The radii depend on the positions, which depend on the radii.\n\nGiven that, maybe the initial code's approach of placing circles in rings is not optimal, and a better approach is needed.\n\nLet me think of a different structure. Suppose I arrange the circles in a 5x5 grid with some spacing, but that's probably not efficient. Alternatively, use a combination of rows with offset circles to form a hexagonal pattern.\n\nFor example, for 26 circles, arrange them in 5 rows. The first row has 5 circles, the second row has 6, the third 5, fourth 6, fifth 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into regions. For example, place 4 circles in each corner, then 12 along the edges, and 10 in the center area. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAnother idea: look at the existing code's sum_radii of 0.9598. The target is 2.635, which is about 2.7 times larger. This suggests that the current arrangement is very inefficient, with most circles having very small radii. So the problem is not just the number of circles, but their placement.\n\nPerhaps the main issue is that the current code places too many circles near the edges, which limits their radii. So, placing more circles in the center area, where they can have larger radii, would be better.\n\nLet me try to construct a new arrangement.\n\nLet's say we have a central cluster of circles, and then other circles arranged around them, but closer to the center so that they are not clipped to the edges.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Place 1 circle in the center: (0.5, 0.5)\n- Place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring, at a distance d from the center.\n- Then, place another 12 circles in a larger", "language": "python", "parent_id": "aaece6f7-34f2-45f1-b6f3-46f7e16a990a", "generation": 1, "timestamp": 1754190771.6498237, "iteration_found": 6, "metrics": {"validity": 0.0, "combined_score": 0.0}, "complexity": 0.0, "diversity": 0.0, "metadata": {"changes": "Full rewrite", "parent_metrics": {"validity": 1.0, "sum_radii": 0.9597642169962064, "target_ratio": 0.36423689449571406, "combined_score": 0.36423689449571406, "eval_time": 1.581624984741211}, "island": 2}, "artifacts_json": "{\"stderr\": \"Stage 1 evaluation failed: Program execution failed: unterminated string literal (detected at line 8) (tmptk6f5mos.py, line 8)\", \"traceback\": \"Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \\\"/workspaces/openevolve/examples/circle_packing_with_artifacts/evaluator.py\\\", line 362, in evaluate_stage1\\n    centers, radii, sum_radii = run_with_timeout(program_path, timeout_seconds=600)\\n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n  File \\\"/workspaces/openevolve/examples/circle_packing_with_artifacts/evaluator.py\\\", line 172, in run_with_timeout\\n    raise RuntimeError(f\\\"Program execution failed: {results['error']}\\\")\\nRuntimeError: Program execution failed: unterminated string literal (detected at line 8) (tmptk6f5mos.py, line 8)\\n\", \"failure_stage\": \"stage1_execution\", \"suggestion\": \"Check basic syntax and imports before attempting full evaluation\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "prompts": {"full_rewrite_user": {"system": "You are an expert mathematician specializing in circle packing problems and computational geometry.

The user wants me to improve the circle packing program for 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of radii. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is around 2.635 as mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper. So there's a big gap here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the current approach isn't achieving that. The existing code places a central circle, then 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But maybe this arrangement isn't optimal. The problem is that the current method uses a simple radial placement, which might not utilize space efficiently, especially near the edges.\n\nThe key insights from the user's notes are about hexagonal packing, edge effects, and varying radii. So maybe a more efficient pattern, like a hexagonal grid, would help. But with 26 circles, how to arrange them? Let's think about typical circle packing arrangements. \n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each layer adds more circles. Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii. Maybe adjusting the clipping or the initial positions can help.\n\nAlso, the compute_max_radii function scales radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this is a greedy approach and might not find the optimal radii. Maybe there's a better way to compute the radii, perhaps using a more systematic method like solving a system of equations for the constraints, but that might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but the user wants an explicit constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598. So maybe that error isn't the main issue here, but it's a bug that needs fixing. So in the new code, I need to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct the circle placement. Let me think of a better arrangement.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid with some layers. For example, arrange circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple rows. For 26 circles, maybe 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. But I need to think of a way to place them.\n\nAlternatively, look at the standard circle packing in a square. For example, for n=26, there might be a known configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of an arrangement that can be constructed manually.\n\nLet me consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at 0.7 radius from the center. That might be too close to the edges. For example, if the center is at 0.5, then adding 0.7 in x direction would take it to 1.2, but then the code clips it to 0.99, which reduces the radius. So maybe the initial positions are not optimal.\n\nAnother idea: use a more efficient arrangement where circles are placed closer to the edges, allowing for larger radii. For example, having circles along the edges, but arranged in a way that they can have larger radii without overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, using a combination of different layers. Maybe a central circle, then a ring around it with 6 circles, then another ring with 12, and so on. Let's see:\n\n- 1 + 6 = 7\n- 1 + 6 + 12 = 19\n- 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 = 37, which is more than 26. So for 26, maybe 1 + 6 + 12 + 7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a square arrangement with some circles in the corners and along the edges. For example, place circles in the four corners, then along the edges, and then in the center.\n\nBut I need to think of a way to place all 26 circles with as much symmetry as possible to maximize the sum of radii.\n\nAlternatively, look at the existing code's structure. It has a central circle, 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But 8 around a central circle is a square ring, which is less dense than a hexagonal ring. Maybe changing the 8 to 6, and adding more layers.\n\nWait, the current code has 8 circles around the center. That would form a square ring, which is not the densest possible. A hexagonal ring would have 6 circles. But then, the code is using 8, which might be leading to suboptimal packing.\n\nSo perhaps changing the initial arrangement to use a hexagonal pattern. For example:\n\n- 1 center circle.\n- 6 circles in a hexagonal ring around it.\n- Then another ring with 12 circles, but that would be 19 circles. Then, adding 7 more circles in some way.\n\nBut how to place them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current approach of using a central circle with two rings is not the best. Let me think of a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: use a grid of circles arranged in rows and columns, but with offsets to form a hexagonal pattern. For example, for 26 circles, arrange them in a 5x5 grid, but with some adjustments. However, that's 25 circles. Adding one more in a corner.\n\nBut the problem is that a square grid is less efficient than a hexagonal grid. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 26 circles as 3 layers: center, 6 in the first ring, 12 in the second ring, and 7 in a third ring. But that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the initial code has a mistake in the number of circles. Let me check again:\n\nIn the code:\n\ncenters[0] = [0.5, 0.5]\n\nThen for i in range(8):\n\ncenters[i+1] = ... \u2192 indexes 1 to 8 (8 circles)\n\nThen for i in range(16):\n\ncenters[i+9] = ... \u2192 indexes 9 to 24 (16 circles)\n\nSo that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles. The 26th is not placed. So that's a bug. So the code is not initializing all 26 circles. That would definitely be a problem. So the user's current code is incorrect. So that's one thing to fix.\n\nSo, the first step is to ensure that all 26 circles are placed. Then, adjust their positions for better packing.\n\nSo, the revised code should place all 26 circles properly.\n\nNow, considering that, perhaps the initial arrangement can be improved.\n\nLet me think of a possible better arrangement. For example, using a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let's say:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle (center)\n- Layer 1: 6 circles around it (hexagonal ring)\n- Layer 2: 12 circles around that (another hexagonal ring)\n- Total so far: 1 + 6 + 12 = 19 circles\n- Then, for the remaining 7 circles, maybe place them in a partial ring or adjust positions.\n\nAlternatively, for 26 circles, maybe 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But how to place those 7?\n\nAlternatively, use a different approach. Maybe a square with circles in the corners and along the edges, and then fill the center.\n\nBut I need to think of a way to construct this.\n\nAnother approach: look at the AlphaEvolve paper's method. Since the user mentioned that AlphaEvolve achieved 2.635, which is much higher than the current 0.9598, the current code must have a significant flaw. The current sum is way too low, which suggests that the initial positions are not optimal, leading to very small radii due to proximity to edges or overlaps.\n\nSo, the problem is that the initial positions are not optimal. Therefore, the key is to find a better arrangement of circles that allows for larger radii without overlapping and staying within the square.\n\nLet me think of a better initial placement. For example, placing circles closer to the edges but arranged in a way that their radii can be larger. For example, placing circles along the edges with some spacing, and then filling the center area with more circles.\n\nBut how to balance that?\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at 0.7 units from the center. But if the square is of size 1, then the maximum distance from the center to the edge is 0.5. Wait, no. The center is at (0.5, 0.5), and the maximum distance to the edge is 0.5 in any direction. So placing circles at 0.7 units from the center would take them beyond the square's edge. But the code clips them to 0.99, which is 0.49 units away from the edge. Therefore, those outer circles are placed very close to the edge, which limits their radii.\n\nSo perhaps the initial placement of the outer ring is too far from the center, leading to clipping and small radii.\n\nTherefore, maybe adjusting the initial positions to be closer to the center, allowing for larger radii without clipping.\n\nFor example, instead of placing the outer ring at 0.7 units from the center, place them closer. Let's think about the maximum radius a circle can have in the square. If a circle is placed at (x, y), its maximum radius is the minimum of x, y, 1-x, 1-y. So to maximize the radius, the circle should be as far as possible from the edges.\n\nTherefore, placing circles in the center region would allow for larger radii. However, with 26 circles, it's a trade-off between packing density and proximity to the edges.\n\nSo maybe a better approach is to use a hexagonal grid in the center area, with circles placed in a way that they are as far from the edges as possible.\n\nAlternatively, think of dividing the square into regions. For example, place circles in a hexagonal pattern that fits within the square.\n\nBut without knowing the exact optimal configuration, I need to design an arrangement that is plausible.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose I arrange the circles in a hexagonal grid with multiple layers. For example:\n\n- 1 circle in the center.\n- 6 circles around it, each at a distance of r1 from the center.\n- 12 circles around those, at a distance of r2 from the center.\n- Then, adjust positions so that all circles are within the square and have as large a radius as possible.\n\nBut how to compute r1 and r2?\n\nAlternatively, use the following approach:\n\n- Place the circles in a hexagonal grid with certain spacing, ensuring that they are all within the square and that their radii are maximized based on their proximity to the edges and other circles.\n\nBut since this is a constructor function, I need to hardcode the positions.\n\nAnother idea: use a configuration similar to the known best for n=26. Since I can't look it up, but the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635, which is much higher than the current sum, the current arrangement is very suboptimal. So the initial positions are likely not good.\n\nLet me think of a different arrangement. For example, instead of one large circle in the center, use multiple circles arranged in a way that allows for larger total radii.\n\nMaybe a more even distribution of circles, avoiding having one large central circle that limits the size of surrounding circles.\n\nAlternatively, use a configuration where all circles have similar radii, arranged in a hexagonal pattern.\n\nBut how to arrange 26 circles in a hexagonal pattern within a square?\n\nLet me think of the number of circles per layer. For a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each concentric layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. So:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle (center)\n- Layer 1: 6 circles\n- Layer 2: 12 circles\n- Layer 3: 18 circles\n\nSo for 26 circles, that would be 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. So layer 0 (1), layer 1 (6), layer 2 (12), and then 7 circles in a partial layer.\n\nBut how to place them?\n\nAssuming the center is at (0.5, 0.5), the first layer (layer 1) would be placed at a distance d from the center. The second layer would be at 2d, and so on. But the exact positions depend on the spacing between circles.\n\nThe distance between centers of adjacent circles in a hexagonal packing is 2r, where r is the radius of the circles. However, since the radii may vary, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, assuming all circles have the same radius, which might not be optimal, but for simplicity. If all circles have the same radius, then the distance between centers of adjacent circles is 2r. However, the problem is that the edge circles will have a smaller radius due to proximity to the square's edges.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the sum of radii, perhaps varying radii would be better, allowing some circles to be larger if they are placed in the center, and smaller ones near the edges.\n\nBut without knowing the exact optimal configuration, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me try to construct a new arrangement.\n\nFirst, place 1 circle in the center: (0.5, 0.5). Let's call this circle 0.\n\nThen, place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring. The distance from the center to each of these circles should be such that they are not overlapping with the center circle. If the center circle has radius r0, then the distance between centers should be at least 2r0. Let's say the distance is 2r0. Then the 6 circles are placed at a distance of 2r0 from the center.\n\nBut since all circles will have varying radii, this approach might not work. Alternatively, assume that all circles have the same radius, r. Then, the distance between centers is 2r. The distance from the center to the edge of the square would be 0.5 - r (if the circle is at the edge of the square). But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the maximum possible radius for each circle based on their position. For example, the central circle can have a radius of up to 0.5 (since it's at the center, distance to the edge is 0.5). However, if other circles are placed around it, their proximity will limit the radius.\n\nBut this seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. The radii depend on the positions, which depend on the radii.\n\nGiven that, maybe the initial code's approach of placing circles in rings is not optimal, and a better approach is needed.\n\nLet me think of a different structure. Suppose I arrange the circles in a 5x5 grid with some spacing, but that's probably not efficient. Alternatively, use a combination of rows with offset circles to form a hexagonal pattern.\n\nFor example, for 26 circles, arrange them in 5 rows. The first row has 5 circles, the second row has 6, the third 5, fourth 6, fifth 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into regions. For example, place 4 circles in each corner, then 12 along the edges, and 10 in the center area. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAnother idea: look at the existing code's sum_radii of 0.9598. The target is 2.635, which is about 2.7 times larger. This suggests that the current arrangement is very inefficient, with most circles having very small radii. So the problem is not just the number of circles, but their placement.\n\nPerhaps the main issue is that the current code places too many circles near the edges, which limits their radii. So, placing more circles in the center area, where they can have larger radii, would be better.\n\nLet me try to construct a new arrangement.\n\nLet's say we have a central cluster of circles, and then other circles arranged around them, but closer to the center so that they are not clipped to the edges.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Place 1 circle in the center: (0.5, 0.5)\n- Place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring, at a distance d from the center.\n- Then, place another 12 circles in a larger"]}}}
