The user wants me to improve the circle packing program for 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of radii. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is around 2.635 as mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper. So there's a big gap here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the current approach isn't achieving that. The existing code places a central circle, then 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But maybe this arrangement isn't optimal. The problem is that the current method uses a simple radial placement, which might not utilize space efficiently, especially near the edges.\n\nThe key insights from the user's notes are about hexagonal packing, edge effects, and varying radii. So maybe a more efficient pattern, like a hexagonal grid, would help. But with 26 circles, how to arrange them? Let's think about typical circle packing arrangements. \n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each layer adds more circles. Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii. Maybe adjusting the clipping or the initial positions can help.\n\nAlso, the compute_max_radii function scales radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this is a greedy approach and might not find the optimal radii. Maybe there's a better way to compute the radii, perhaps using a more systematic method like solving a system of equations for the constraints, but that might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but the user wants an explicit constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598. So maybe that error isn't the main issue here, but it's a bug that needs fixing. So in the new code, I need to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct the circle placement. Let me think of a better arrangement.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid with some layers. For example, arrange circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple rows. For 26 circles, maybe 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. But I need to think of a way to place them.\n\nAlternatively, look at the standard circle packing in a square. For example, for n=26, there might be a known configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of an arrangement that can be constructed manually.\n\nLet me consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at a radius of 0.7 from the center. However, since the square has sides of length 1, placing circles at 0.7 radius from the center might make them too close to the edges. For example, the center is at (0.5, 0.5). A circle placed at (0.5 + 0.7*cos(theta), 0.5 + 0.7*sin(theta)) would have coordinates that could be up to 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2, which is outside the square. Hence, the code clips them to 0.99, which reduces their radii. So maybe the outer ring's radius is too large, causing the clipping and reducing the possible radii.\n\nSo perhaps adjusting the positions of the outer circles to be closer to the center, allowing for larger radii without clipping.\n\nAnother idea: instead of placing circles in a single ring, maybe use multiple concentric rings with varying radii, ensuring that all circles are within the square and have sufficient space between them.\n\nAlternatively, use a more efficient pattern where circles are arranged in a hexagonal grid but adjusted for the square's boundaries.\n\nLet me think of the following arrangement:\n\n- One central circle.\n\n- Then, a first ring of 6 circles around it, placed at a distance of d1 from the center.\n\n- A second ring of 12 circles, placed at a distance of d2 from the center.\n\n- Then, maybe a third ring of 7 circles, but that might not add up to 26. Let's check:\n\n1 (center) + 6 (first ring) + 12 (second ring) + 7 (third ring) = 26. That works. So that's 26 circles.\n\nBut how to place them? For the first ring, each circle is at a distance of d1 from the center, arranged in a hexagon. For the second ring, they might be placed at a distance of d2, but in positions between the first ring's circles. The third ring would be in the corners or along the edges.\n\nThis is similar to the hexagonal packing. However, the exact positions need to be calculated so that all circles are within the square and their radii can be maximized.\n\nBut how to compute the positions and radii?\n\nAlternatively, look for an existing configuration. For example, the known optimal packing for 26 circles in a square. But without knowing that, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the existing code has a central circle and two rings, but the second ring is too large, leading to clipping. So perhaps reducing the outer ring's radius and adding more circles in the inner rings.\n\nWait, the current code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but n=26. So that's a mistake. So the code should have 1 + 8 + 17? Or 1 + 9 + 16? That's unclear. So the first correction is to fix that.\n\nSo in the code, the loop for the 8 circles is from i=0 to 7, placing circles 1-8. Then the 16 circles are placed starting at index 9, which would be indices 9-24 (16 circles). That's 1+8+16=25. The 26th circle is missing. So that's a bug. So the code must be fixed to place all 26 circles.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct that. Maybe the user intended to have 1 + 8 + 17 circles? Or perhaps there's another ring. For example, maybe the second ring should have 17 circles, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the code is missing one circle, which would have a very small radius, dragging down the sum. So fixing that is crucial.\n\nBut given that the current sum is 0.9598, which is way below the target of 2.635, there's a lot more to fix.\n\nAnother observation: the current code uses compute_max_radii, which scales radii to prevent overlaps. However, this method might not be optimal. For example, when two circles are close, their radii are scaled down, which might be suboptimal compared to a more precise calculation.\n\nBut given that the user wants a constructor that directly produces the arrangement, not an iterative algorithm, the approach must be to find a specific arrangement where the radii can be calculated based on distances between centers and the square's edges.\n\nPerhaps the key is to find a better arrangement of centers that allows for larger radii without overlapping and staying within the square.\n\nLet me think of an alternative arrangement. For example, arrange the circles in a hexagonal grid, but adjusted to fit into the square. For 26 circles, maybe arrange them in 5 rows, with varying numbers of circles per row. For example, rows with 6, 7, 6, 5, 2 circles? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in a hexagonal packing, the distance between centers is 2r, where r is the radius. So if the centers are arranged in a grid with horizontal spacing of 2r and vertical spacing of sqrt(3)*r, then the circles won't overlap. However, the exact positions need to be adjusted to fit into the square.\n\nBut how to fit 26 circles in that pattern?\n\nAlternatively, look for an arrangement that uses as much of the square as possible. For example, placing circles in a hexagonal pattern in the lower half of the square, then another set in the upper half, but that's vague.\n\nAnother idea: use a known configuration from literature. For example, the AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26. So perhaps their arrangement is a specific one. Since I can't access that paper, I need to infer.\n\nA possible approach is to create multiple layers around the center, with each layer having more circles. For example:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle (center)\n- Layer 1: 6 circles (hexagonal around center)\n- Layer 2: 12 circles (hexagonal around layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 7 circles (to reach 1+6+12+7=26)\n\nBut how to place layer 3? Maybe in the corners or along the edges.\n\nBut how to calculate the positions for these layers?\n\nFor each layer, the distance from the center increases. The first layer (layer 1) is at a distance d1, the second at d2, etc.\n\nBut to ensure that the circles are within the square, the maximum distance from the center to any circle's center must be such that the circle doesn't exceed the square's boundaries. For example, if a circle is placed at (0.5 + x, 0.5 + y), then x and y must be such that the radius doesn't cause the circle to go beyond 0 or 1.\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the new code:\n\n1. Correct the circle placement to include all 26 circles. For example, use a structure with 1 (center), 6 (first ring), 12 (second ring), and 7 (third ring) circles.\n\n2. Place the centers in a hexagonal pattern, ensuring they are within the square.\n\n3. Compute the radii based on the minimum distance to adjacent circles and the square's edges.\n\nBut how to compute the radii? For each circle, the radius is the minimum of the distance to the nearest circle's center divided by 2 and the distance to the square's edge.\n\nWait, if all circles are placed with centers at least 2r apart, then the maximum possible r is determined by the minimal distance between centers divided by 2. However, the square's edges impose an additional constraint: the radius can't exceed the distance from the circle's center to the nearest edge.\n\nSo for each circle, r_i = min( (distance to nearest neighbor)/2, distance to edge )\n\nBut this assumes that all circles are placed with equal spacing. However, in reality, the distances between neighbors vary, so this might not be optimal. But for a structured arrangement, this could be a starting point.\n\nLet me try to design such an arrangement.\n\nFirst, define the center at (0.5, 0.5). Then, for the first ring (6 circles), place them at a distance d from the center. The distance between adjacent circles in the first ring is 2d * sin(\u03c0/6) = d. Wait, no. For a regular hexagon, the distance between adjacent centers is equal to the radius of the circle (distance from center to each vertex). So if the first ring is placed at distance d from the center, then the distance between adjacent circles in the ring is d. Thus, the minimal distance between any two adjacent circles in the first ring is d, so the maximum radius for these circles would be d/2. Similarly, the distance between the central circle and the first ring is d, so the central circle's radius plus the first ring's radius must be <= d. If the central circle has radius r0 and the first ring has radius r1, then r0 + r1 <= d. If we want to maximize the sum, we need to choose r0 and r1 such that this holds.\n\nBut if we make all circles in the first ring have the same radius, and the central circle also the same, then r0 + r1 = d. So if we set r0 = r1 = d/2, then the sum would be r0 + 6*r1 = d/2 + 6*(d/2) = (7d)/2.\n\nBut this is just for the first ring. Then, the second ring would be placed at a distance from the center that allows for a larger radius. However, the distance from the center to the second ring's circles must be such that the distance between the first ring and the second ring is sufficient to prevent overlap.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe manageable for a structured approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the optimal configuration for n=26 is a hexagonal packing with certain parameters. For example, the first ring has 6 circles, the second 12, and the third 7, as mentioned earlier. Then, the centers are placed in a way that maximizes the minimal distance between circles and edges.\n\nBut without knowing the exact positions, this is challenging.\n\nAnother idea: use a grid with horizontal and vertical spacing, but adjusted for the square. For example, arrange the circles in a grid with rows and columns, but with some offset between rows to form a hexagonal pattern.\n\nFor example, for a grid with m rows and n columns, with each row offset by half a spacing, leading to a hexagonal packing. However, the exact number of rows and columns would depend on the total number of circles.\n\nBut with 26 circles, perhaps 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. For example, rows with 6, 7, 6, 5, 2 circles? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as being divided into regions where each region contains a certain number of circles. For example, the corners could have clusters of circles, and the edges have others.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Perhaps I should look for a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me think of the existing code's problem. It places circles in a central position, then two rings. The first ring (8 circles) around the center. Wait, in a hexagonal pattern, there should be 6 circles around a central one. So the current code has 8 circles in the first ring, which is not a hexagonal arrangement. That might be inefficient.\n\nSo, changing the first ring to 6 circles instead of 8 might help. Then, the second ring could have 12 circles, totaling 1+6+12=19, and then adding 7 more circles in a third ring. That would make 26.\n\nBut how to place these?\n\nFor the first ring (6 circles), placed at a distance d1 from the center. The second ring (12 circles) placed at a distance d2 from the center, such that the distance between the first ring and the second ring is sufficient to prevent overlap. The distance between the first ring and the second ring's circles would be d2 - d1. To prevent overlap, this should be at least 2r, where r is the radius of the circles in the first and second rings.\n\nAssuming all circles have the same radius r, then d2 - d1 >= 2r.\n\nBut also, the distance between adjacent circles in the second ring would be 2r, as in a hexagonal pattern. So the distance between adjacent second ring circles is 2r, which is the same as the distance between the first ring and second ring.\n\nThis is getting complex, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet's assume all circles have the same radius r. Then:\n\n- Distance from center to first ring circles: d1 = 2r (since the central circle has radius r, and the first ring circles are placed at distance 2r so that their centers are 2r apart from the central circle's center, allowing for r + r = 2r, which is the minimal distance to prevent overlap).\n\n- The first ring circles are placed in a hexagonal pattern around the center. The distance between adjacent first ring circles is 2r (since in a hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius of the circle around the center).\n\n- The second ring circles are placed at a distance of d2 from the center. The distance between the first ring and second ring circles should be at least 2r. The minimal distance between a first ring circle and a second ring circle is d2 - d1. So d2 - d1 >= 2r. If we set d2 = d1 + 2r = 2r + 2r = 4r.\n\n- The second ring circles are placed in a hexagonal pattern around the center, with each circle at distance d2 = 4r. The distance between adjacent second ring circles would be 2r * sqrt(3) ? Wait, no.

The user wants me to improve the circle packing program for 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of radii. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is around 2.635 as mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper. So there's a big gap here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the current approach isn't achieving that. The existing code places a central circle, then 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But maybe this arrangement isn't optimal. The problem is that the current method uses a simple radial placement, which might not utilize space efficiently, especially near the edges.\n\nThe key insights from the user's notes are about hexagonal packing, edge effects, and varying radii. So maybe a more efficient pattern, like a hexagonal grid, would help. But with 26 circles, how to arrange them? Let's think about typical circle packing arrangements. \n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each layer adds more circles. Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii. Maybe adjusting the clipping or the initial positions can help.\n\nAlso, the compute_max_radii function scales radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this is a greedy approach and might not find the optimal radii. Maybe there's a better way to compute the radii, perhaps using a more systematic method like solving a system of equations for the constraints, but that might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but the user wants an explicit constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598. So maybe that error isn't the main issue here, but it's a bug that needs fixing. So in the new code, I need to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct the circle placement. Let me think of a better arrangement.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid with some layers. For example, arrange circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple rows. For 26 circles, maybe 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. But I need to think of a way to place them.\n\nAlternatively, look at the standard circle packing in a square. For example, for n=26, there might be a known configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of an arrangement that can be constructed manually.\n\nLet me consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at a radius of 0.7 from the center. However, since the square has sides of length 1, placing circles at 0.7 radius from the center might make them too close to the edges. For example, the center is at (0.5, 0.5). A circle placed at (0.5 + 0.7*cos(theta), 0.5 + 0.7*sin(theta)) would have coordinates that could be up to 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2, which is outside the square. Hence, the code clips them to 0.99, which reduces their radii. So maybe the outer ring's radius is too large, causing the clipping and reducing the possible radii.\n\nSo perhaps adjusting the positions of the outer circles to be closer to the center, allowing for larger radii without clipping.\n\nAnother idea: instead of placing circles in a single ring, maybe use multiple concentric rings with varying radii, ensuring that all circles are within the square and have sufficient space between them.\n\nAlternatively, use a more efficient pattern where circles are arranged in a hexagonal grid but adjusted to fit into the square. For example, arrange the circles in a grid with rows offset by half the circle diameter, but adjusted so that they fit within the square.\n\nBut how to translate that into code?\n\nAlternatively, look for existing known configurations. For example, in the literature, for n=26, the optimal packing might have a certain structure. However, without specific knowledge, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me think of a possible arrangement. Suppose we have a central circle, then a ring of 6 circles around it, then another ring of 12 circles, and maybe some more. Wait, 1 + 6 + 12 = 19. Then adding another 7 circles? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into regions. For example, four corners with clusters, and some along the edges.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of layers. Let me try to think of a way to place 26 circles in a more optimal way.\n\nAnother approach: instead of using a fixed radius for each ring, calculate the positions based on the desired spacing. For example, if circles are placed in a hexagonal grid, the distance between centers should be at least twice the radius (assuming all circles have the same radius). However, since the radii might vary, this complicates things.\n\nBut the current code uses a compute_max_radii function which scales the radii based on the distances between centers. However, this might not be optimal because scaling is done pairwise, which could lead to suboptimal radii for some circles.\n\nSo, perhaps a better way is to design the positions in such a way that the minimal distance between any two centers is maximized, allowing for larger radii. This is essentially the circle packing problem where you want to maximize the minimum radius, but here the goal is to maximize the sum of radii, which may involve varying radii.\n\nBut since the user wants an explicit constructor, not an algorithm that iteratively optimizes, I need to come up with a specific arrangement.\n\nLet me consider that the current code's main issue is the inefficient placement of circles. For example, the outer ring is too far from the center, leading to clipping and thus smaller radii. Let me try to adjust that.\n\nLet me think of a different configuration. Suppose I have multiple concentric rings. For example, the first ring (center) has 1 circle, the second ring has 6, the third has 12, and the fourth has 7. That totals 1+6+12+7=26. But how to arrange them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more balanced approach. Let me try to create a structure where the circles are placed in a hexagonal pattern, with positions calculated such that they fit within the square and have sufficient spacing.\n\nFor example, for a hexagonal grid, each circle is placed at positions (i + 0.5*j, j*sqrt(3)/2), but adjusted to fit into the square. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use a more empirical approach. Let's say the current code has a central circle, 8 surrounding it (which is more than a hexagonal ring of 6), and then 16 in the outer ring. But maybe that's not optimal. Let's think of a better way to arrange 26 circles.\n\nAnother thought: the current code's outer ring has 16 circles. Placing 16 circles in a ring around the center would require them to be spaced every 22.5 degrees (since 360/16=22.5). But this might lead to a larger radius for the outer ring, causing clipping. Instead, perhaps using a smaller radius for the outer ring, allowing for larger radii.\n\nLet me try adjusting the code to place the outer ring at a smaller radius. For example, instead of 0.7, maybe 0.4 or 0.5. Let's see. The center is at (0.5, 0.5). If the outer ring is placed at a radius r from the center, then the maximum distance from the square's edge would be 0.5 - (0.5 + r) = 0.5 - (0.5 + r) = -r? Wait, no. The distance from the center to the edge is 0.5 units. So if a circle is placed at a distance d from the center, then its maximum radius is limited by the distance to the square's edge. For example, if the circle is at (0.5 + d*cos(theta), 0.5 + d*sin(theta)), then the distance to the nearest edge is min(0.5 - d*cos(theta), 0.5 - d*sin(theta), 0.5 - (1 - (0.5 + d*cos(theta)))), etc. This is getting complex, but perhaps placing the outer ring at a smaller radius would allow for larger radii.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial positions are not optimal. For example, the current code's outer ring is placed at 0.7 from the center, but that's too far. Let's try placing the outer ring at a smaller radius. Let's say 0.4. Then, the circles would be placed at 0.5 + 0.4*cos(theta), etc. Then, the distance from the square's edge would be 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1, which would limit the radius to 0.1. That's small, but maybe better than the current approach.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a more efficient arrangement where circles are closer together but with varying radii. For example, some circles near the edges can be smaller, allowing others in the center to be larger.\n\nBut how to model that in code?\n\nAnother idea: instead of having all circles in rings, use a more compact arrangement. For example, two layers of hexagonal packing. Let's say the first layer has 7 circles (1 center and 6 around it), the second layer has 19 circles. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into regions. For example, four quadrants, each with a cluster of circles. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, look at the problem from the perspective of the AlphaEvolve paper. They achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26. That's a much higher sum than the current 0.9598. So the current code is way off. This suggests that the current approach is very suboptimal. Therefore, the initial placement of circles is not good, and the compute_max_radii function is not effective.\n\nSo, the main problem is the initial placement of the circles. The current code's arrangement is too simplistic and inefficient. Therefore, the solution must involve a better initial arrangement of the circles.\n\nLet me try to think of a better arrangement. For example, in the AlphaEvolve paper, they might have used a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let me try to create a hexagonal grid with multiple layers.\n\nFor example, in a hexagonal grid, each layer has 6n circles, where n is the layer number. So layer 0 has 1 circle (center), layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles:\n\n1 (layer 0) + 6 (layer 1) + 12 (layer 2) = 19. Then, layer 3 has 18, but we need 26-19=7 more. So maybe 7 circles in a partial layer.\n\nBut how to arrange these in the square? Let me think of the positions.\n\nEach circle in layer k is placed at a distance of k * (2r) from the center, where r is the radius of the circles. But since the circles can have varying radii, this complicates things. However, assuming all circles have the same radius, the distance between centers would be 2r. But since the goal is to maximize the sum of radii, perhaps varying radii would allow for a better packing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a combination of layers with different radii. For example, the central circle is larger, then the surrounding ones are smaller, allowing for tighter packing.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me try to implement a more structured approach.\n\nLet me think of the following arrangement:\n\n- One central circle.\n- A first ring of 6 circles around it.\n- A second ring of 12 circles.\n- A third ring of 7 circles.\n\nTotal 1+6+12+7=26. Now, how to place these in the square.\n\nThe central circle is at (0.5, 0.5). The first ring of 6 circles would be placed at a distance of d1 from the center. The second ring at distance d2, and the third at d3. The positions need to be calculated such that they don't exceed the square's boundaries.\n\nBut how to determine d1, d2, d3? Also, the radii of the circles would be limited by the distance to their neighbors and to the square's edges.\n\nLet me try to calculate these distances.\n\nAssuming all circles have the same radius r, the distance between the center and the first ring would be 2r (since the circles touch each other). Similarly, the distance between the first and second ring would be 2r. The distance between the second and third ring would be 2r. But this is for equal radii. However, if the radii vary, this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that all circles have the same radius, then the positions can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor the first ring (6 circles), their centers are at a distance of 2r from the center. For the second ring (12 circles), the distance from the center would be 4r, since each subsequent layer adds another 2r. The third ring would be at 6r.\n\nNow, the maximum distance from the center to any circle's center is 6r. Since the square has side length 1, the distance from the center to the edge is 0.5. So, 6r + r (the radius of the outermost circle) must be \u2264 0.5. Wait, no. The distance from the center to the edge of the square is 0.5. The distance from the center to the center of the outermost circle is 6r. Then, the radius of that outer circle must be such that 6r + r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 7r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 r \u2264 0.5/7 \u2248 0.0714. That's very small. But this is assuming all circles have the same radius, which might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, if the outer circles have smaller radii, allowing the inner ones to have larger radii. This is the approach used in the AlphaEvolve paper, perhaps.\n\nBut how to model this in code without iterative optimization?\n\nThis is tricky. Another approach is to look for known optimal configurations for n=26. Since I can't look it up, I need to think of a plausible arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the current code's sum is 0.9598, which is way below the target of 2.635. This suggests that the current arrangement is very inefficient. Therefore, the main issue is the initial placement of circles, which is not optimal.\n\nLet me try to create a more efficient arrangement. For example, instead of placing 8 circles around the center, use a hexagonal ring of 6, then another ring of 12, and a third ring of 7, totaling 26. Let's try that.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the new construct_packing function:\n\n1. Place the central circle at (0.5, 0.5).\n2. Place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring. The distance from the center to each of these is d1.\n3. Place 12 circles in the next ring, with distance d2 from the center.\n4. Place 7 circles in the third ring, with distance d3 from the center.\n\nBut how to calculate d1, d2, d3 to ensure the circles fit within the square and don't overlap.\n\nAssuming all circles have the same radius r, then:\n\n- Between the central circle and the first ring: distance between centers is 2r (they touch).\n- Between the first ring and the second ring: distance between centers is 2r (they touch).\n- Between the second ring and the third ring: distance between centers is 2r.\n\nThe maximum distance from the center to the outermost circle's center is d3 + r (since the outer circle's radius is r). This must be \u2264 0.5 (distance from center to square edge). So:\n\nd3 + r \u2264 0.5\n\nAlso, d3 = 4r (since each ring adds 2r). So:\n\n4r + r = 5r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 r \u2264 0.1.\n\nThat's still\n```\nKey features: Performs well on validity (0.0000), Performs well on combined_score (0.0000)\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.8540, Type: High-Performer)\n```python\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START\n\"\"\"Constructor-based circle packing for n=26 circles\"\"\"\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef construct_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Construct a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square\n    that attempts to maximize the sum of their radii.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (centers, radii, sum_of_radii)\n        centers: np.array of shape (26, 2) with (x, y) coordinates\n        radii: np.array of shape (26) with radius of each circle\n        sum_of_radii: Sum of all radii\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize arrays for 26 circles\n    n = 26\n    centers = np.zeros((n, 2))\n\n    # Place circles in a structured pattern\n    # This is a simple pattern - evolution will improve this\n\n    # First, place a large circle in the center\n    centers[0] = [0.5, 0.5]\n\n    # Place 8 circles around it in a ring\n    for i in range(8):\n        angle = 2 * np.pi * i / 8\n        centers[i + 1] = [0.5 + 0.3 * np.cos(angle), 0.5 + 0.3 * np.sin(angle)]\n\n    # Place 16 more circles in an outer ring\n    for i in range(16):\n        angle = 2 * np.pi * i / 16\n        centers[i + 9] = [0.5 + 0.7 * np.cos(angle), 0.5 + 0.7 * np.sin(angle)]\n\n    # Additional positioning adjustment to make sure all circles\n    # are inside the square and don't overlap\n    # Clip to ensure everything is inside the unit square\n    centers = np.clip(centers, 0.01, 0.99)\n\n    # Compute maximum valid radii for this configuration\n    radii = compute_max_radii(centers)\n\n    # Calculate the sum of radii\n    sum_radii = np.sum(radii)\n\n    return centers, radii, sum_radii\n\n\ndef compute_max_radii(centers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the maximum possible radii for each circle position\n    such that they don't overlap and stay within the unit square.\n\n    Args:\n        centers: np.array of shape (n, 2) with (x, y) coordinates\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array of shape (n) with radius of each circle\n    \"\"\"\n    n = centers.shape[0]\n    radii = np.ones(n)\n\n    # First, limit by distance to square borders\n    for i in range(n):\n        x, y = centers[i]\n        # Distance to borders\n        radii[i] = min(x, y, 1 - x, 1 - y)\n\n    # Then, limit by distance to other circles\n    # Each pair of circles with centers at distance d can have\n    # sum of radii at most d to avoid overlap\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            dist = np.sqrt(np.sum((centers[i] - centers[j]) ** 2))\n\n            # If current radii would cause overlap\n            if radii[i] + radii[j] > dist:\n                # Scale both radii proportionally\n                scale = dist / (radii[i] + radii[j])\n                radii[i] *= scale\n                radii[j] *= scale\n\n    return radii\n\n\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n\n\n# This part remains fixed (not evolved)\ndef run_packing():\n    \"\"\"Run the circle packing constructor for n=26\"\"\"\n    centers, radii, sum_radii = construct_packing()\n    return centers, radii, sum_radii\n\n\ndef visualize(centers, radii):\n    \"\"\"\n    Visualize the circle packing\n\n    Args:\n        centers: np.array of shape (n, 2) with (x, y) coordinates\n        radii: np.array of shape (n) with radius of each circle\n    \"\"\"\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    from matplotlib.patches import Circle\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))\n\n    # Draw unit square\n    ax.set_xlim(0, 1)\n    ax.set_ylim(0, 1)\n    ax.set_aspect(\"equal\")\n    ax.grid(True)\n\n    # Draw circles\n    for i, (center, radius) in enumerate(zip(centers, radii)):\n        circle = Circle(center, radius, alpha=0.5)\n        ax.add_patch(circle)\n        ax.text(center[0], center[1], str(i), ha=\"center\", va=\"center\")\n\n    plt.title(f\"Circle Packing (n={len(centers)}, sum={sum(radii):.6f})\")\n    plt.show()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    centers, radii, sum_radii = run_packing()\n    print(f\"Sum of radii: {sum_radii}\")\n    # AlphaEvolve improved this to 2.635\n\n    # Uncomment to visualize:\n    visualize(centers, radii)\n\n```\nUnique approach: Excellent validity (1.000), Excellent sum_radii (0.960), Excellent eval_time (1.582)\n\n\n\n# Current Program\n```python\n<think>\nOkay, let's see.

Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii. Maybe adjusting the clipping or the initial positions can help.\n\nAlso, the compute_max_radii function scales radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this is a greedy approach and might not find the optimal radii. Maybe there's a better way to compute the radii, perhaps using a more systematic method like solving a system of equations for the constraints, but that might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but the user wants an explicit constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598. So maybe that error isn't the main issue here, but it's a bug that needs fixing. So in the new code, I need to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct the circle placement. Let me think of a better arrangement.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid with some layers. For example, arrange circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple rows. For 26 circles, maybe 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. But I need to think of a way to place them.\n\nAlternatively, look at the standard circle packing in a square. For example, for n=26, there might be a known configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of an arrangement that can be constructed manually.\n\nLet me consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at a radius of 0.7 from the center. However, since the square has sides of length 1, placing circles at 0.7 radius from the center might make them too close to the edges. For example, the center is at (0.5, 0.5). A circle placed at (0.5 + 0.7*cos(theta), 0.5 + 0.7*sin(theta)) would have coordinates that could be up to 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2, which is outside the square. Hence, the code clips them to 0.99, which reduces their radii. So maybe the outer ring's radius is too large, causing the clipping and reducing the possible radii.\n\nSo perhaps adjusting the positions of the outer circles to be closer to the center, allowing for larger radii without clipping.\n\nAnother idea: instead of placing circles in a single ring, maybe use multiple concentric rings with varying radii, ensuring that all circles are within the square and have sufficient space between them.\n\nAlternatively, use a more efficient pattern where circles are arranged in a hexagonal grid but adjusted for the square's boundaries.\n\nLet me think of the following arrangement:\n\n- One central circle.\n\n- Then, a first ring of 6 circles around it, placed at a distance of d1 from the center.\n\n- A second ring of 12 circles, placed at a distance of d2 from the center.\n\n- Then, maybe a third ring of 7 circles, but that might not add up to 26. Let's check:\n\n1 (center) + 6 (first ring) + 12 (second ring) + 7 (third ring) = 26. That works. So that's 26 circles.\n\nBut how to place them? For the first ring, each circle is at a distance of d1 from the center, arranged in a hexagon. For the second ring, they might be placed at a distance of d2, but in positions between the first ring's circles. The third ring would be in the corners or along the edges.\n\nThis is similar to the hexagonal packing. However, the exact positions need to be calculated so that all circles are within the square and their radii can be maximized.\n\nBut how to compute the positions and radii?\n\nAlternatively, look for an existing configuration. For example, the known optimal packing for 26 circles in a square. But without knowing that, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the existing code has a central circle and two rings, but the second ring is too large, leading to clipping. So perhaps reducing the outer ring's radius and adding more circles in the inner rings.\n\nWait, the current code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but n=26. So that's a mistake. So the code should have 1 + 8 + 17? Or 1 + 9 + 16? That's unclear. So the first correction is to fix that.\n\nSo in the code, the loop for the 8 circles is from i=0 to 7, placing circles 1-8. Then the 16 circles are placed starting at index 9, which would be indices 9-24 (16 circles). That's 1+8+16=25. The 26th circle is missing. So that's a bug. So the code must be fixed to place all 26 circles.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct that. Maybe the user intended to have 1 + 8 + 17 circles? Or perhaps there's another ring. For example, maybe the second ring should have 17 circles, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the code is missing one circle, which would have a very small radius, dragging down the sum. So fixing that is crucial.\n\nBut given that the current sum is 0.9598, which is way below the target of 2.635, there's a lot more to fix.\n\nAnother observation: the current code uses compute_max_radii, which scales radii to prevent overlaps. However, this method might not be optimal. For example, when two circles are close, their radii are scaled down, which might be suboptimal compared to a more precise calculation.\n\nBut given that the user wants a constructor that directly produces the arrangement, not an iterative algorithm, the approach must be to find a specific arrangement where the radii can be calculated based on distances between centers and the square's edges.\n\nPerhaps the key is to find a better arrangement of centers that allows for larger radii without overlapping and staying within the square.\n\nLet me think of an alternative arrangement. For example, arrange the circles in a hexagonal grid, but adjusted to fit into the square. For 26 circles, maybe arrange them in 5 rows, with varying numbers of circles per row. For example, rows with 6, 7, 6, 5, 2 circles? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in a hexagonal packing, the distance between centers is 2r, where r is the radius. So if the centers are arranged in a grid with horizontal spacing of 2r and vertical spacing of sqrt(3)*r, then the circles won't overlap. However, the exact positions need to be adjusted to fit into the square.\n\nBut how to fit 26 circles in that pattern?\n\nAlternatively, look for an arrangement that uses as much of the square as possible. For example, placing circles in a hexagonal pattern in the lower half of the square, then another set in the upper half, but that's vague.\n\nAnother idea: use a known configuration from literature. For example, the AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26. So perhaps their arrangement is a specific one. Since I can't access that paper, I need to infer.\n\nA possible approach is to create multiple layers around the center, with each layer having more circles. For example:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle (center)\n- Layer 1: 6 circles (hexagonal around center)\n- Layer 2: 12 circles (hexagonal around layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 7 circles (to reach 1+6+12+7=26)\n\nBut how to place layer 3? Maybe in the corners or along the edges.\n\nBut how to calculate the positions for these layers?\n\nFor each layer, the distance from the center increases. The first layer (layer 1) is at a distance d1, the second at d2, etc.\n\nBut to ensure that the circles are within the square, the maximum distance from the center to any circle's center must be such that the circle doesn't exceed the square's boundaries. For example, if a circle is placed at (0.5 + x, 0.5 + y), then x and y must be such that the radius doesn't cause the circle to go beyond 0 or 1.\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the new code:\n\n1. Correct the circle placement to include all 26 circles. For example, use a structure with 1 (center), 6 (first ring), 12 (second ring), and 7 (third ring) circles.\n\n2. Place the centers in a hexagonal pattern, ensuring they are within the square.\n\n3. Compute the radii based on the minimum distance to adjacent circles and the square's edges.\n\nBut how to compute the radii? For each circle, the radius is the minimum of the distance to the nearest circle's center divided by 2 and the distance to the square's edge.\n\nWait, if all circles are placed with centers at least 2r apart, then the maximum possible r is determined by the minimal distance between centers divided by 2. However, the square's edges impose an additional constraint: the radius can't exceed the distance from the circle's center to the nearest edge.\n\nSo for each circle, r_i = min( (distance to nearest neighbor)/2, distance to edge )\n\nBut this assumes that all circles are placed with equal spacing. However, in reality, the distances between neighbors vary, so this might not be optimal. But for a structured arrangement, this could be a starting point.\n\nLet me try to design such an arrangement.\n\nFirst, define the center at (0.5, 0.5). Then, for the first ring (6 circles), place them at a distance d from the center. The distance between adjacent circles in the first ring is 2d * sin(\u03c0/6) = d. Wait, no. For a regular hexagon, the distance between adjacent centers is equal to the radius of the circle (distance from center to each vertex). So if the first ring is placed at distance d from the center, then the distance between adjacent circles in the ring is d. Thus, the minimal distance between any two adjacent circles in the first ring is d, so the maximum radius for these circles would be d/2. Similarly, the distance between the central circle and the first ring is d, so the central circle's radius plus the first ring's radius must be <= d. If the central circle has radius r0 and the first ring has radius r1, then r0 + r1 <= d. If we want to maximize the sum, we need to choose r0 and r1 such that this holds.\n\nBut if we make all circles in the first ring have the same radius, and the central circle also the same, then r0 + r1 = d. So if we set r0 = r1 = d/2, then the sum would be r0 + 6*r1 = d/2 + 6*(d/2) = (7d)/2.\n\nBut this is just for the first ring. Then, the second ring would be placed at a distance from the center that allows for a larger radius. However, the distance from the center to the second ring's circles must be such that the distance between the first ring and the second ring is sufficient to prevent overlap.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe manageable for a structured approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the optimal configuration for n=26 is a hexagonal packing with certain parameters. For example, the first ring has 6 circles, the second 12, and the third 7, as mentioned earlier. Then, the centers are placed in a way that maximizes the minimal distance between circles and edges.\n\nBut without knowing the exact positions, this is challenging.\n\nAnother idea: use a grid with horizontal and vertical spacing, but adjusted for the square. For example, arrange the circles in a grid with rows and columns, but with some offset between rows to form a hexagonal pattern.\n\nFor example, for a grid with m rows and n columns, with each row offset by half a spacing, leading to a hexagonal packing. However, the exact number of rows and columns would depend on the total number of circles.\n\nBut with 26 circles, perhaps 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. For example, rows with 6, 7, 6, 5, 2 circles? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as being divided into regions where each region contains a certain number of circles. For example, the corners could have clusters of circles, and the edges have others.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Perhaps I should look for a more systematic approach.\n\nLet me think of the existing code's problem. It places circles in a central position, then two rings. The first ring (8 circles) around the center. Wait, in a hexagonal pattern, there should be 6 circles around a central one. So the current code has 8 circles in the first ring, which is not a hexagonal arrangement. That might be inefficient.\n\nSo, changing the first ring to 6 circles instead of 8 might help. Then, the second ring could have 12 circles, totaling 1+6+12=19, and then adding 7 more circles in a third ring. That would make 26.\n\nBut how to place these?\n\nFor the first ring (6 circles), placed at a distance d1 from the center. The second ring (12 circles) placed at a distance d2 from the center, such that the distance between the first ring and the second ring is sufficient to prevent overlap. The distance between the first ring and the second ring's circles would be d2 - d1. To prevent overlap, this should be at least 2r, where r is the radius of the circles in the first and second rings.\n\nAssuming all circles have the same radius r, then d2 - d1 >= 2r.\n\nBut also, the distance between adjacent circles in the second ring would be 2r, as in a hexagonal pattern. So the distance between adjacent second ring circles is 2r, which is the same as the distance between the first ring and second ring.\n\nThis is getting complex, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet's assume all circles have the same radius r. Then:\n\n- Distance from center to first ring circles: d1 = 2r (since the central circle has radius r, and the first ring circles are placed at distance 2r so that their centers are 2r apart from the central circle's center, allowing for r + r = 2r, which is the minimal distance to prevent overlap).\n\n- The first ring circles are placed in a hexagonal pattern around the center. The distance between adjacent first ring circles is 2r (since in a hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius of the circle around the center).\n\n- The second ring circles are placed at a distance of d2 from the center. The distance between the first ring and second ring circles should be at least 2r. The minimal distance between a first ring circle and a second ring circle is d2 - d1. So d2 - d1 >= 2r. If we set d2 = d1 + 2r = 2r + 2r = 4r.\n\n- The second ring circles are placed in a hexagonal pattern around the center, with each circle at distance d2 = 4r. The distance between adjacent second ring circles would be 2r * sqrt(3) ? Wait, no.
