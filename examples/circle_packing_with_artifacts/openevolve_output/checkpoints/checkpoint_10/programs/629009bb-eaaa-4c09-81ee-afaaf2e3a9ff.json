{"id": "629009bb-eaaa-4c09-81ee-afaaf2e3a9ff", "code": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the given Python program for circle packing with 26 circles in a unit square. The current sum of radii is 0.9598, but the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635. So there's a big gap here. But the user isn't asking for an optimization algorithm; they want a constructor function that directly produces the specific arrangement, not an iterative search.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the existing code. The current approach places one circle in the center, 8 around it in a ring, and 16 in an outer ring. Then it computes the maximum radii by clipping to the square borders and scaling radii to prevent overlaps. However, this approach might not be optimal because the initial placement is too simplistic.\n\nThe problem is that the current configuration is probably not dense enough. The sum of radii is way below the target. To improve this, I need to think about more efficient circle arrangements. Since the AlphaEvolve result is much higher, there must be a better configuration.\n\nLet me recall that in circle packing, hexagonal arrangements are more efficient. Maybe the existing code's layers are too spaced out. For example, the first ring of 8 circles is placed at radius 0.3 from the center, and the outer ring at 0.7. But perhaps these distances are too large, leading to smaller radii.\n\nAnother thought: the current code uses a fixed radius for each layer, but maybe varying radii could allow for better packing. Also, the initial positions might not account for edge effects properly. The code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, but maybe that's causing unnecessary constraints.\n\nWait, the main issue is that the initial positions are not optimized. The current code's approach is to manually place circles in rings, but without considering the optimal spacing between them. The compute_max_radii function then adjusts the radii, but if the initial positions are suboptimal, the radii will be limited by the distances between the centers.\n\nSo to maximize the sum of radii, the initial positions need to be as close as possible to each other, allowing for larger radii. But how to arrange 26 circles optimally?\n\nResearching circle packing in squares, I know that for n=26, there's a known optimal or near-optimal configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of a way to structure the circles in a more efficient pattern.\n\nPerhaps using multiple concentric layers. For example, a central circle, then layers around it. For 26 circles, maybe:\n\n- 1 center\n- 6 in the first ring (hexagonal)\n- 12 in the second ring\n- 7 in the third? Wait, that adds up to 1+6+12+7=26? No, 1+6+12+7=26? 1+6=7, 7+12=19, 19+7=26. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, think of a hexagonal packing with multiple shells. Each shell adds more circles. However, in a square, the packing might not be perfectly hexagonal due to the edges.\n\nAnother approach is to use a grid-like structure, but with circles arranged in a way that minimizes spacing. Maybe a combination of rows and columns with circles placed in a staggered pattern.\n\nWait, but the user wants a constructor that directly produces the arrangement, not an algorithm that iteratively finds it. So I need to manually design the positions.\n\nLet me think of the AlphaEvolve result of 2.635. The current code's sum is 0.9598, which is much lower. That suggests that the initial positions are not efficient. So the problem is that the initial positions are too far apart, leading to small radii.\n\nTherefore, I need to find a way to arrange the 26 circles such that their centers are as close as possible, allowing for larger radii. For example, using a hexagonal grid with as many circles as possible.\n\nBut how to arrange 26 circles in a hexagonal pattern within a square?\n\nLet me think of the number of circles per layer. In a hexagonal packing, each layer around a central circle adds 6n circles, where n is the layer number. But for a square, the arrangement might not be perfect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal configuration for 26 circles is a combination of multiple layers. For example:\n\n- One central circle.\n- First layer: 6 circles around it, forming a hexagon.\n- Second layer: 12 circles around the first layer.\n- Third layer: 7 circles. Total 1+6+12+7=26. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 26 circles can be arranged in 5 rows with varying numbers. For example, in a square, you might have rows with 6, 7, 6, 7, 6 circles. But that would be 6+7+6+7+6=32, which is more than 26. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of a grid where each circle is placed in a hexagonal pattern. For example, for a hexagonal grid, each circle has six neighbors. But fitting that into a square is tricky.\n\nAnother idea: use a known configuration. For example, for n=26, perhaps the optimal is a hexagonal packing with some circles on the edges.\n\nBut without knowing the exact configuration, I need to make an educated guess. Let's think about the current code. The initial code has a central circle, 8 in a ring, and 16 in an outer ring. That totals 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, in the code:\n\n- 1 center\n- 8 in the first ring (i+1 from 1 to 8)\n- 16 in the outer ring (i+9 from 9 to 24). Wait, 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. But the code is for 26 circles. Oh, maybe there's a typo? Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the code:\n\ncenters[0] = [0.5, 0.5]\n\nThen for i in 0-7 (8 circles), centers[1-8] are set.\n\nThen for i in 0-15 (16 circles), centers[9-24] are set. So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. But the code is for n=26. Oh, maybe there's an error in the code. Wait, the code says n=26, but the centers array is initialized to 26 elements, but the code only fills 25. That's a problem. Wait, in the code:\n\ncenters = np.zeros((n, 2)) where n=26.\n\nThen centers[0] is set, then 8 more (indices 1-8), then 16 (indices 9-24). That's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. So the 26th circle is not placed. That's a bug. So the current code is missing one circle. That's probably why the sum of radii is low, because one circle is missing. But the user's current code might have that error.\n\nBut the user's problem is that the current code has a sum_radii of 0.9598, which is way below the target. So the code is not placing all circles, but the user's problem is to improve the existing code.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct. Wait, let me check again:\n\nIn the code:\n\nfor i in range(8): centers[i + 1] = ... \u2192 that's 8 circles (indices 1-8). Then for i in 16: centers[i + 9] \u2192 i ranges 0-15, so centers[9-24] (16 circles). So total is 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. The 26th circle is not placed. So that's a bug. That's probably a mistake in the code. So the current code is incorrect. But the user's current program is as given, and the task is to improve it. So perhaps that's part of the problem.\n\nBut the user might not have mentioned that. So the first thing to fix is that the code is missing one circle. But maybe that's not the main issue here. However, that would contribute to the low sum of radii.\n\nBut assuming that the user's code is correct, perhaps the arrangement is not optimal.\n\nSo, to improve the code, I need to find a better arrangement of the 26 circles.\n\nLet me think of a better way to arrange the circles. Let's consider that in a square, the densest packing would have circles arranged in a hexagonal pattern as much as possible, with some circles on the edges.\n\nFor 26 circles, perhaps the configuration is as follows:\n\n- 1 circle in the center.\n- 6 circles around it, forming a hexagon.\n- Then, the next layer could have 12 circles.\n- Then, 7 circles on the outer edges. But that adds up to 1+6+12+7=26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But I need to figure out how to place them.\n\nAlternatively, think of layers:\n\nLayer 0: 1 circle (center)\nLayer 1: 6 circles (around center)\nLayer 2: 12 circles (around layer 1)\nLayer 3: 7 circles (on the edges)\n\nBut how to place these in a square?\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into rows and columns with staggered positions.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid. For a hexagonal grid, each row has more circles than the previous, but in a square, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, use a known configuration. Since the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635, which is much higher than the current code's 0.9598, it's clear that the current approach is not optimal.\n\nThe main problem is that the initial placement of the centers is not optimal. The current code's arrangement has circles placed in concentric rings with fixed radii, but those radii might be too large, leading to small radii after the compute_max_radii function.\n\nSo, to improve this, I need to find a better way to place the centers so that the distances between them are minimized, allowing for larger radii.\n\nPerhaps using a more efficient hexagonal packing. For example, in a hexagonal arrangement, each circle has 6 neighbors at a distance of 2r, where r is the radius. But in a square, the packing would have to be adjusted.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Place the circles in a hexagonal grid pattern, with multiple rows and columns, but adjusting the positions to fit within the square.\n\nFor example, for 26 circles, perhaps arrange them in 6 rows with varying numbers of circles. For example:\n\nRow 1: 5 circles\nRow 2: 6 circles\nRow 3: 5 circles\nRow 4: 6 circles\nRow 5: 5 circles\nRow 6: 5 circles\n\nBut that adds up to 5+6+5+6+5+5=32, which is more than 26. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of a hexagonal packing with 5 layers. For example:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle\n- Layer 1: 6 circles\n- Layer 2: 12 circles\n- Layer 3: 18 circles. But that would be more than 26.\n\nAlternatively, for 26 circles, perhaps arrange them in a hexagonal pattern with 5 layers:\n\n- 1 (layer 0)\n- 6 (layer 1)\n- 12 (layer 2)\n- 7 (layer 3) \u2192 total 1+6+12+7=26.\n\nBut how to place those in a square?\n\nLet me think of the coordinates for each layer.\n\nLayer 0: center at (0.5, 0.5).\n\nLayer 1: 6 circles around it. Each at a distance of d from the center. The distance between the center and the first layer circles should be 2r, where r is the radius of the circles in the first layer. But since all circles have the same radius, the distance between centers would be 2r. However, in reality, circles in different layers may have different radii.\n\nBut if we assume that all circles have the same radius, then the distance between centers should be at least 2r. However, the current code allows varying radii, so perhaps varying radii can lead to better packing.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. The user wants a constructor that directly produces the arrangement, not an algorithm that iterates to find it. So I need to manually define the positions.\n\nAnother idea: use a hexagonal grid with circles arranged in rows, where each row is offset from the previous. For example:\n\nFor a square, the circles are arranged in rows with horizontal spacing of 2r and vertical spacing of sqrt(3)*r. But in a square, the vertical spacing may need to be adjusted.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, think of the known best configuration for 26 circles. Since the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635, which is much higher than the current code's 0.9598, it's clear that the initial approach is not optimal. The current code's sum is way too low. So the problem is that the initial positions are not close enough, leading to small radii.\n\nSo, to improve the sum, the initial positions should be as close as possible. For example, if I can arrange the circles in a hexagonal pattern where each circle is touching its neighbors, then the radii would be larger.\n\nBut how to do that manually?\n\nLet me think of a hexagonal packing with multiple circles. For example, if I have a central circle, surrounded by 6 circles, then each of those 6 has another circle around them, etc. But in a square, this may not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, think of a grid with rows. For example, 5 rows with 5, 6, 5, 6, 5 circles. That's 27 circles, but perhaps adjusting.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for an existing solution or think of a way to generate a better configuration.\n\nWait, the user's current code has a problem where it's only placing 25 circles. That's a bug. So fixing that would be the first step. But the user's current code may have that, but the task is to improve the existing code.\n\nBut regardless, the main issue is the arrangement.\n\nAnother idea: use a more compact arrangement by reducing the spacing between the circles. For example, instead of placing the first ring at 0.3 from the center, maybe place it closer. But how to calculate the correct distance to prevent overlaps.\n\nBut the compute_max_radii function adjusts the radii based on the distance between centers. So if the centers are placed too close, the radii will be scaled down to prevent overlaps. However, if the initial positions are too far apart, the radii will be limited by the distance between centers.\n\nSo, the key is to find an initial configuration where the centers are as close as possible to each other, allowing the radii to be as large as possible without overlapping.\n\nPerhaps the current code's rings are too large. For example, the first ring is placed at 0.3 from the center. That distance would be the distance between the central circle and the first ring circles. But if the circles in the first ring are touching the central circle, then the distance between their centers is 2r. So if the central circle has radius r0, and the first ring has radius r1, then the distance between centers would be r0 + r1. But if they are touching, then that distance is r0 + r1. But if all circles have the same radius, then the distance is 2r.\n\nBut in the current code, the radii are computed after the centers are placed, so the initial positions may not be optimized for the radii.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is to define the centers in such a way that they are as close as possible to each other, allowing for larger radii.\n\nFor example, using a hexagonal packing with multiple layers.\n\nLet me try to define the centers in a hexagonal pattern.\n\nLet's say we have a central circle at (0.5, 0.5). Then, the first layer (6 circles) around it, each at a distance of d from the center. The next layer (12 circles) around the first layer, each at a distance of 2d from the center. Then, the third layer (7 circles) on the edges. But how to place these in a square.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a way to generate a better initial configuration.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum of radii in the AlphaEvolve paper is 2.635, which is about 2.635. The current code's sum is 0.9598, which is about 0.96. So the current code's radii are about 0.037 each (0.96/26). To reach 2.635, the average radius would be around 0.101. So the current code is way below that. Thus, the initial positions must be much closer.\n\nSo, the main problem is that the initial centers are too far apart. So I need to find a better way to place the centers.\n\nMaybe instead of using concentric rings, use a more compact arrangement. For example, place the circles in a grid pattern with rows and columns, but with staggered positions to form a hexagonal pattern.\n\nFor example, for 26 circles, perhaps arrange them in 6 rows with 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 5 circles. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 5 circles\nRow 2: 6 circles (offset)\nRow 3: 5 circles\nRow 4: 6 circles (offset)\nRow 5: 5 circles\nRow 6: 5 circles\n\nTotal: 5+6+5+6+5+5=32. Still too many. But if I reduce to 26, maybe 5 rows: 5, 6, 5, 6, 4. That's 26. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of a hexagonal grid with 5 rows, where each row has 5, 6, 5, 6, 5 circles. But again, this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of a grid where each circle is placed at positions (x, y) with x and y spaced", "language": "python", "parent_id": "75ee60f7-f9c7-411d-a557-dca2e9b6b595", "generation": 1, "timestamp": 1754261013.7558706, "iteration_found": 6, "metrics": {"validity": 0.0, "combined_score": 0.0, "llm_readability": 0.07500000000000001, "llm_maintainability": 0.065, "llm_efficiency": 0.05500000000000001}, "complexity": 0.0, "diversity": 0.0, "metadata": {"changes": "Full rewrite", "parent_metrics": {"validity": 1.0, "sum_radii": 0.9597642169962064, "target_ratio": 0.36423689449571406, "combined_score": 0.36423689449571406, "eval_time": 1.6287438869476318, "llm_readability": 0.08000000000000002, "llm_maintainability": 0.06, "llm_efficiency": 0.06}, "island": 0}, "artifacts_json": "{\"stderr\": \"Stage 1 evaluation failed: Program execution failed: unterminated string literal (detected at line 2) (tmpglfeuopu.py, line 2)\", \"traceback\": \"Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \\\"/workspaces/openevolve/examples/circle_packing_with_artifacts/evaluator.py\\\", line 362, in evaluate_stage1\\n    centers, radii, sum_radii = run_with_timeout(program_path, timeout_seconds=600)\\n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n  File \\\"/workspaces/openevolve/examples/circle_packing_with_artifacts/evaluator.py\\\", line 172, in run_with_timeout\\n    raise RuntimeError(f\\\"Program execution failed: {results['error']}\\\")\\nRuntimeError: Program execution failed: unterminated string literal (detected at line 2) (tmpglfeuopu.py, line 2)\\n\", \"failure_stage\": \"stage1_execution\", \"suggestion\": \"Check basic syntax and imports before attempting full evaluation\", \"reasoning\": \"The code is readable with clear function names and comments, but the dense nested loops and complex radius calculation logic could be more modular.

The user wants me to improve the given Python program for circle packing with 26 circles in a unit square. The current sum of radii is 0.9598, but the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635. So there's a big gap here. But the user isn't asking for an optimization algorithm; they want a constructor function that directly produces the specific arrangement, not an iterative search.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the existing code. The current approach places one circle in the center, 8 around it in a ring, and 16 in an outer ring. Then it computes the maximum radii by clipping to the square borders and scaling radii to prevent overlaps. However, this approach might not be optimal because the initial placement is too simplistic.\n\nThe problem is that the current configuration is probably not dense enough. The sum of radii is way below the target. To improve this, I need to think about more efficient circle arrangements. Since the AlphaEvolve result is much higher, there must be a better configuration.\n\nLet me recall that in circle packing, hexagonal arrangements are more efficient. Maybe the existing code's layers are too spaced out. For example, the first ring of 8 circles is placed at radius 0.3 from the center, and the outer ring at 0.7. But perhaps these distances are too large, leading to smaller radii.\n\nAnother thought: the current code uses a fixed radius for each layer, but maybe varying radii could allow for better packing. Also, the initial positions might not account for edge effects properly. The code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, but maybe that's causing unnecessary constraints.\n\nWait, the main issue is that the initial positions are not optimized. The current code's approach is to manually place circles in rings, but without considering the optimal spacing between them. The compute_max_radii function then adjusts the radii, but if the initial positions are suboptimal, the radii will be limited by the distances between the centers.\n\nSo to maximize the sum of radii, the initial positions need to be as close as possible to each other, allowing for larger radii. But how to arrange 26 circles optimally?\n\nResearching circle packing in squares, I know that for n=26, there's a known optimal or near-optimal configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of a way to structure the circles in a more efficient pattern.\n\nPerhaps using multiple concentric layers. For example, a central circle, then layers around it. For 26 circles, maybe:\n\n- 1 center\n- 6 in the first ring (hexagonal)\n- 12 in the second ring\n- 7 in the third? Wait, that adds up to 1+6+12+7=26? No, 1+6+12+7=26? 1+6=7, 7+12=19, 19+7=26. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, think of a hexagonal packing with multiple shells. Each shell adds more circles. However, in a square, the packing might not be perfectly hexagonal due to the edges.\n\nAnother approach is to use a grid-like structure, but with circles arranged in a way that minimizes spacing. Maybe a combination of rows and columns with circles placed in a staggered pattern.\n\nWait, but the user wants a constructor that directly produces the arrangement, not an algorithm that iteratively finds it. So I need to manually design the positions.\n\nLet me think of the AlphaEvolve result of 2.635. The current code's sum is 0.9598, which is much lower. That suggests that the initial positions are not efficient. So the problem is that the initial positions are too far apart, leading to small radii.\n\nTherefore, I need to find a way to arrange the 26 circles such that their centers are as close as possible, allowing for larger radii. For example, using a hexagonal grid with as many circles as possible.\n\nBut how to arrange 26 circles in a hexagonal pattern within a square?\n\nLet me think of the number of circles per layer. In a hexagonal packing, each layer around a central circle adds 6n circles, where n is the layer number. But for a square, the arrangement might not be perfect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal configuration for 26 circles is a combination of multiple layers. For example:\n\n- One central circle.\n- First layer: 6 circles around it, forming a hexagon.\n- Second layer: 12 circles around the first layer.\n- Third layer: 7 circles. Total 1+6+12+7=26. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 26 circles can be arranged in 5 rows with varying numbers. For example, in a square, you might have rows with 6, 7, 6, 7, 6 circles. But that would be 6+7+6+7+6=32, which is more than 26. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of a grid where each circle is placed in a hexagonal pattern. For example, for a hexagonal grid, each circle has six neighbors. But fitting that into a square is tricky.\n\nAnother idea: use a known configuration. For example, for n=26, perhaps the optimal is a hexagonal packing with some circles on the edges.\n\nBut without knowing the exact configuration, I need to make an educated guess. Let's think about the current code. The initial code has a central circle, 8 in a ring, and 16 in an outer ring. That totals 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, in the code:\n\n- 1 center\n- 8 in the first ring (i+1 from 1 to 8)\n- 16 in the outer ring (i+9 from 9 to 24). Wait, 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. But the code is for 26 circles. Oh, maybe there's a typo? Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the code:\n\ncenters[0] = [0.5, 0.5]\n\nThen for i in 0-7 (8 circles), centers[1-8] are set.\n\nThen for i in 0-15 (16 circles), centers[9-24] are set. So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. But the code is for n=26. Oh, maybe there's an error in the code. Wait, the code says n=26, but the centers array is initialized to 26 elements, but the code only fills 25. That's a problem. Wait, in the code:\n\ncenters = np.zeros((n, 2)) where n=26.\n\nThen centers[0] is set, then 8 more (indices 1-8), then 16 (indices 9-24). That's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. So the 26th circle is not placed. That's a bug. So the current code is missing one circle. That's probably why the sum of radii is low, because one circle is missing. But the user's current code might have that error.\n\nBut the user's problem is that the current code has a sum_radii of 0.9598, which is way below the target. So the code is not placing all circles, but the user's problem is to improve the existing code.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct. Wait, let me check again:\n\nIn the code:\n\nfor i in range(8): centers[i + 1] = ... \u2192 that's 8 circles (indices 1-8). Then for i in 16: centers[i + 9] \u2192 i ranges 0-15, so centers[9-24] (16 circles). So total is 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. The 26th circle is not placed. So that's a bug. That's probably a mistake in the code. So the current code is incorrect. But the user's current program is as given, and the task is to improve it. So perhaps that's part of the problem.\n\nBut the user might not have mentioned that. So the first thing to fix is that the code is missing one circle. But maybe that's not the main issue here. However, that would contribute to the low sum of radii.\n\nBut assuming that the user's code is correct, perhaps the arrangement is not optimal.\n\nSo, to improve the code, I need to find a better arrangement of the 26 circles.\n\nLet me think of a better way to arrange the circles. Let's consider that in a square, the densest packing would have circles arranged in a hexagonal pattern as much as possible, with some circles on the edges.\n\nFor 26 circles, perhaps the configuration is as follows:\n\n- 1 circle in the center.\n- 6 circles around it, forming a hexagon.\n- Then, the next layer could have 12 circles.\n- Then, 7 circles on the outer edges. But that adds up to 1+6+12+7=26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But I need to figure out how to place them.\n\nAlternatively, think of layers:\n\nLayer 0: 1 circle (center)\nLayer 1: 6 circles (around center)\nLayer 2: 12 circles (around layer 1)\nLayer 3: 7 circles (on the edges)\n\nBut how to place these in a square?\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into rows and columns with staggered positions.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid. For a hexagonal grid, each row has more circles than the previous, but in a square, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, use a known configuration. Since the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635, which is much higher than the current code's 0.9598, it's clear that the current approach is not optimal.\n\nThe main problem is that the initial placement of the centers is not optimal. The current code's arrangement has circles placed in concentric rings with fixed radii, but those radii might be too large, leading to small radii after the compute_max_radii function.\n\nSo, to improve this, I need to find a better way to place the centers so that the distances between them are minimized, allowing for larger radii.\n\nPerhaps using a more efficient hexagonal packing. For example, in a hexagonal arrangement, each circle has 6 neighbors at a distance of 2r, where r is the radius. But in a square, the packing would have to be adjusted.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Place the circles in a hexagonal grid pattern, with multiple rows and columns, but adjusting the positions to fit within the square.\n\nFor example, for 26 circles, perhaps arrange them in 6 rows with varying numbers of circles. For example:\n\nRow 1: 5 circles\nRow 2: 6 circles\nRow 3: 5 circles\nRow 4: 6 circles\nRow 5: 5 circles\nRow 6: 5 circles\n\nBut that adds up to 5+6+5+6+5+5=32, which is more than 26. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of a hexagonal packing with 5 layers. For example:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 circle\n- Layer 1: 6 circles\n- Layer 2: 12 circles\n- Layer 3: 18 circles. But that would be more than 26.\n\nAlternatively, for 26 circles, perhaps arrange them in a hexagonal pattern with 5 layers:\n\n- 1 (layer 0)\n- 6 (layer 1)\n- 12 (layer 2)\n- 7 (layer 3) \u2192 total 1+6+12+7=26.\n\nBut how to place those in a square?\n\nLet me think of the coordinates for each layer.\n\nLayer 0: center at (0.5, 0.5).\n\nLayer 1: 6 circles around it. Each at a distance of d from the center. The distance between the center and the first layer circles should be 2r, where r is the radius of the circles in the first layer. But since all circles have the same radius, the distance between centers would be 2r. However, in reality, circles in different layers may have different radii.\n\nBut if we assume that all circles have the same radius, then the distance between centers should be at least 2r. However, the current code allows varying radii, so perhaps varying radii can lead to better packing.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. The user wants a constructor that directly produces the arrangement, not an algorithm that iterates to find it. So I need to manually define the positions.\n\nAnother idea: use a hexagonal grid with circles arranged in rows, where each row is offset from the previous. For example:\n\nFor a square, the circles are arranged in rows with horizontal spacing of 2r and vertical spacing of sqrt(3)*r. But in a square, the vertical spacing may need to be adjusted.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, think of the known best configuration for 26 circles. Since the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635, which is much higher than the current code's 0.9598, it's clear that the initial approach is not optimal. The current code's sum is way too low. So the problem is that the initial positions are not close enough, leading to small radii.\n\nSo, to improve the sum, the initial positions should be as close as possible. For example, if I can arrange the circles in a hexagonal pattern where each circle is touching its neighbors, then the radii would be larger.\n\nBut how to do that manually?\n\nLet me think of a hexagonal packing with multiple circles. For example, if I have a central circle, surrounded by 6 circles, then each of those 6 has another circle around them, etc. But in a square, this may not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, think of a grid with rows. For example, 5 rows with 5, 6, 5, 6, 5 circles. That's 27 circles, but perhaps adjusting.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for an existing solution or think of a way to generate a better configuration.\n\nWait, the user's current code has a problem where it's only placing 25 circles. That's a bug. So fixing that would be the first step. But the user's current code may have that, but the task is to improve the existing code.\n\nBut regardless, the main issue is the arrangement.\n\nAnother idea: use a more compact arrangement by reducing the spacing between the circles. For example, instead of placing the first ring at 0.3 from the center, maybe place it closer. But how to calculate the correct distance to prevent overlaps.\n\nBut the compute_max_radii function adjusts the radii based on the distance between centers. So if the centers are placed too close, the radii will be scaled down to prevent overlaps. However, if the initial positions are too far apart, the radii will be limited by the distance between centers.\n\nSo, the key is to find an initial configuration where the centers are as close as possible to each other, allowing the radii to be as large as possible without overlapping.\n\nPerhaps the current code's rings are too large. For example, the first ring is placed at 0.3 from the center. That distance would be the distance between the central circle and the first ring circles. But if the circles in the first ring are touching the central circle, then the distance between their centers is 2r. So if the central circle has radius r0, and the first ring has radius r1, then the distance between centers would be r0 + r1. But if they are touching, then that distance is r0 + r1. But if all circles have the same radius, then the distance is 2r.\n\nBut in the current code, the radii are computed after the centers are placed, so the initial positions may not be optimized for the radii.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is to define the centers in such a way that they are as close as possible to each other, allowing for larger radii.\n\nFor example, using a hexagonal packing with multiple layers.\n\nLet me try to define the centers in a hexagonal pattern.\n\nLet's say we have a central circle at (0.5, 0.5). Then, the first layer (6 circles) around it, each at a distance of d from the center. The next layer (12 circles) around the first layer, each at a distance of 2d from the center. Then, the third layer (7 circles) on the edges. But how to place these in a square.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a way to generate a better initial configuration.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum of radii in the AlphaEvolve paper is 2.635, which is about 2.635. The current code's sum is 0.9598, which is about 0.96. So the current code's radii are about 0.037 each (0.96/26). To reach 2.635, the average radius would be around 0.101. So the current code is way below that. Thus, the initial positions must be much closer.\n\nSo, the main problem is that the initial centers are too far apart. So I need to find a better way to place the centers.\n\nMaybe instead of using concentric rings, use a more compact arrangement. For example, place the circles in a grid pattern with rows and columns, but with staggered positions to form a hexagonal pattern.\n\nFor example, for 26 circles, perhaps arrange them in 6 rows with 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 5 circles. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 5 circles\nRow 2: 6 circles (offset)\nRow 3: 5 circles\nRow 4: 6 circles (offset)\nRow 5: 5 circles\nRow 6: 5 circles\n\nTotal: 5+6+5+6+5+5=32. Still too many. But if I reduce to 26, maybe 5 rows: 5, 6, 5, 6, 4. That's 26. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of a hexagonal grid with 5 rows, where each row has 5, 6, 5, 6, 5 circles. But again, this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of a grid where each circle is placed at positions (x, y) with x and y spaced"]}}}
