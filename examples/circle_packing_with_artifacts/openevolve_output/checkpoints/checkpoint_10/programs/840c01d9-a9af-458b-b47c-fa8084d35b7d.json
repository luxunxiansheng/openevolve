{"id": "840c01d9-a9af-458b-b47c-fa8084d35b7d", "code": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the circle packing program for 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of radii. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is around 2.635 as mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper. So there's a big gap here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the current approach isn't achieving that. The existing code places a central circle, then 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But maybe this arrangement isn't optimal. The problem is that the current method uses a simple radial placement, which might not utilize space efficiently, especially near the edges.\n\nThe key insights from the user's notes are about hexagonal packing, edge effects, and varying radii. So maybe a more efficient pattern, like a hexagonal grid, would help. But with 26 circles, how to arrange them? Let's think about typical circle packing arrangements. \n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each layer adds more circles. Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii. Maybe adjusting the clipping or the initial positions can help.\n\nAlso, the compute_max_radii function scales radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this is a greedy approach and might not find the optimal radii. Maybe there's a better way to compute the radii, perhaps using a more systematic method like solving a system of equations for the constraints, but that might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but the user wants an explicit constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598. So maybe that error isn't the main issue here, but it's a bug that needs fixing. So in the new code, I need to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct the circle placement. Let me think of a better arrangement.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid with some layers. For example, arrange circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple rows. For 26 circles, maybe 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. But I need to think of a way to place them.\n\nAlternatively, look at the standard circle packing in a square. For example, for n=26, there might be a known configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of an arrangement that can be constructed manually.\n\nLet me consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at 0.7 radius from the center. That might be too close to the edges. For example, if the center is at 0.5, then adding 0.7 in x direction would take it to 1.2, but then the code clips it to 0.99, which reduces the radius. So maybe the initial positions are not optimal.\n\nAnother idea: use a more efficient arrangement where circles are placed closer to the edges, allowing for larger radii. For example, having circles along the edges, but arranged in a way that they can have larger radii without overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, using a combination of different layers. Maybe a central circle, then a ring around it with 6 circles, then another ring with 12, and so on. Let's see:\n\n- 1 + 6 = 7\n- 1 + 6 + 12 = 19\n- 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 = 37, which is more than 26. So for 26, maybe 1 + 6 + 12 + 7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a square arrangement with some circles in the corners and along the edges. For example, place circles in the four corners, then along the edges, and then in the center.\n\nBut I need to think of a way to place all 26 circles with as much symmetry as possible to maximize the sum of radii.\n\nAlternatively, look at the existing code's structure. It has a central circle, 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But 8 around a central circle is a square ring, which is less dense than a hexagonal ring. Maybe changing the 8 to 6, and adding more layers.\n\nWait, the current code has 8 circles around the center. That would form a square ring, which is not the densest. A hexagonal ring would have 6 circles, but that might not fit with the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 26 circles as 1 in the center, 6 in the first ring, 12 in the second, and 7 in the third. But that adds up to 26. Let's see: 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But how to arrange that?\n\nBut for a hexagonal packing, the first ring around the center has 6 circles. The second ring has 12. Then the third ring would have 18. So 1+6+12=19, then adding 7 would be a partial ring. But that might be messy.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 26 circles as arranged in a way that uses more circles near the edges to utilize the space better.\n\nAnother idea: The current code's outer ring is placed at radius 0.7 from the center. But if the centers are placed closer to the edges, their radii could be larger. For example, if a circle is placed near the corner, its radius can be larger in that direction.\n\nBut how to balance that with overlapping with other circles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial positions are too spread out. For example, the central circle is at (0.5, 0.5). The 8 surrounding circles are at radius 0.3 from the center. That's 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 in x and y, so positions like 0.8, 0.5, etc. But then the outer ring is at 0.7 from the center. So 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2, which is clipped to 0.99, so the actual distance from the center is 0.49. Wait, that's a problem. The outer ring's centers are placed at 0.7 from the center, but then they are clipped to 0.99, which reduces their distance from the edge. That would make their maximum radius smaller than possible.\n\nSo maybe the initial positions are not optimal. For example, placing the outer ring's circles closer to the edges.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible radius for circles near the edges. For example, a circle placed at (0.5, 0.1) would have a maximum radius of 0.1 (distance to the bottom edge). But if it's placed closer to the center, say (0.5, 0.3), then the radius is limited by the distance to the bottom (0.3) and the distance to other circles.\n\nSo perhaps a better strategy is to have circles placed in a way that their proximity to the edges and other circles allows for larger radii.\n\nBut how to design that manually?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the known result from AlphaEvolve. They achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26. The current code's sum is 0.9598, which is way lower. So there's a huge gap. That suggests that the current approach is not even close to optimal.\n\nSo the problem is that the current code's arrangement is not efficient. The initial placement is probably not optimal. So I need to find a better arrangement.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to look for a known configuration or to use a more efficient pattern.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635. So I need to replicate that configuration, but since I can't refer to the paper, I need to think of a way to design a better arrangement.\n\nAnother idea: Use a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let's say:\n\n- 1 circle in the center.\n\n- 6 circles around it, forming the first ring.\n\n- 12 circles in the second ring.\n\n- 7 circles in a third ring (partial).\n\nBut how to place these in a square? Let's think of coordinates.\n\nFor the first ring (6 circles) around the center (0.5, 0.5), their positions would be at a distance r from the center. The distance between adjacent circles in a hexagonal ring is 2r*sin(\u03c0/6) = r. Wait, no, the distance between centers of adjacent circles in a hexagonal ring is 2r, where r is the radius of the circles. But since the circles can't overlap, the distance between centers should be at least 2r. But in the initial code, the circles are placed at a certain distance from the center, which may not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, for the first ring, if the central circle has radius R, then the surrounding 6 circles must be placed at a distance of 2R from the center. So their centers are at (0.5 + 2R*cos(theta), 0.5 + 2R*sin(theta)) for theta = 0, 60, 120, etc. Then, the radius of these surrounding circles can be limited by their proximity to the edges and to each other.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to design the positions of the circles in a way that maximizes their radii, considering both the distance to the edges and to other circles.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each circle is a node, and edges represent constraints (distance between centers must be at least sum of radii). Then, the problem is to assign positions and radii to maximize the sum of radii, subject to these constraints. However, solving this analytically is complex, but for a specific configuration, it might be possible to find a good arrangement.\n\nBut since the user wants a constructor function that directly places each circle, I need to find an explicit arrangement.\n\nAnother thought: The current code's outer ring is placed at a radius of 0.7 from the center, but that's probably too large, causing the circles to be clipped near the edges. So maybe reducing that radius to allow for larger radii without clipping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial positions are not optimal. For example, placing circles in a hexagonal pattern closer to the edges.\n\nBut without knowing the exact configuration from AlphaEvolve, it's challenging. However, I can try to design a more efficient arrangement based on known principles.\n\nLet me consider that the optimal packing for 26 circles would have multiple layers. For example:\n\n- 1 circle in the center.\n\n- 6 circles around it (first ring).\n\n- 12 circles in the second ring.\n\n- 7 circles in a third ring (but this might not be a full ring).\n\nBut how to position these in a square.\n\nLet me try to calculate coordinates for such a configuration.\n\nAssuming the central circle is at (0.5, 0.5). The first ring has 6 circles placed at a distance d1 from the center. The second ring has 12 circles placed at a distance d2 from the center. The third ring has 7 circles.\n\nBut the positions need to be such that the circles don't overlap and are within the square.\n\nLet me think about the distances between the circles. For the first ring (6 circles), each is separated by 60 degrees. The distance between adjacent circles in the first ring would be 2d1 * sin(\u03c0/6) = d1. Wait, the distance between two adjacent circles in the first ring would be 2 * d1 * sin(\u03c0/6) = d1. Since each circle must be at least 2r1 apart from each other, where r1 is the radius of the first ring circles. But if the central circle has radius R, then the distance from the center to the first ring circles is R + r1. So d1 = R + r1.\n\nBut also, the distance between adjacent first ring circles is 2r1. Because they can't overlap. So the distance between two adjacent circles in the first ring is 2r1. But from earlier, this distance is d1 * sqrt(3) (wait, no, let me think again).\n\nWait, for two adjacent circles in a ring around the center: the angle between them is 60 degrees. The distance between their centers is 2d1 * sin(\u03c0/6) = 2d1 * 0.5 = d1. So this distance must be >= 2r1. Therefore, d1 >= 2r1. Also, since the central circle has radius R, and the first ring circles have radius r1, the distance between the center and the first ring circles is R + r1 = d1. Therefore, d1 = R + r1. Combining these, R + r1 >= 2r1 => R >= r1. So the central circle must be at least as large as the first ring circles.\n\nBut this may not be optimal. Maybe having the central circle smaller allows for larger radii overall. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume all circles have the same radius. Then, the distance from the center to the first ring circles would be 2r, and the distance between adjacent first ring circles is also 2r, which fits. But then the central circle would have to have radius r, and the distance from the center to the first ring circles is 2r. But this would require that the first ring circles are placed at 2r from the center. However, the square's edge would limit the maximum possible r. For example, if the first ring circles are placed at a distance of 2r from the center, then the distance from the center to the edge of the square is 0.5. So 2r + r = 3r <= 0.5 => r <= 0.5/3 \u2248 0.1667. Then, the total sum of radii would be 1*r + 6*r + 12*r = 19r \u2248 3.1667, which is higher than the current sum. But this is assuming all circles have the same radius, which may not be optimal. However, this suggests that the current approach of varying radii may not be the best.\n\nBut this is just a hypothetical scenario. In reality, varying radii may allow for better packing.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to design a more efficient configuration.\n\nLet me try to create a configuration with multiple layers, but with more circles near the edges.\n\nFor example, place circles in the corners, along the edges, and in the center. For 26 circles, maybe:\n\n- 4 circles in the corners, each near a corner. Their positions would be (0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.9), (0.9, 0.1), (0.9, 0.9). Each of these can have a radius of 0.1 (distance to the nearest edge).\n\n- Then, along the edges, place circles between the corners. For example, on the bottom edge, between (0.1, 0.1) and (0.9, 0.1), place 3 circles. Similarly on the other edges. That would add 3*4 = 12 circles, totaling 4 + 12 = 16 circles.\n\n- Then, in the center, place a ring of 6 circles, and one in the center. That would be 1 + 6 = 7, totaling 16 + 7 = 23 circles. Need 3 more.\n\nHmm, this is getting messy. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square divided into regions, with circles placed in each region.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here. Perhaps the key issue is the initial arrangement in the current code, which is not efficient. So to improve, I need to find a better arrangement.\n\nLet me think of the following steps for the new code:\n\n1. Correct the circle placement to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed. In the current code, one circle is not placed, leading to a zero radius, which is a bug. So in the new code, I need to ensure all circles are placed.\n\n2. Use a more efficient arrangement, possibly with hexagonal packing or other patterns that maximize the use of space.\n\n3. Adjust the compute_max_radii function to better handle the constraints, possibly by using a more accurate method to calculate radii.\n\nBut since the", "language": "python", "parent_id": "aaece6f7-34f2-45f1-b6f3-46f7e16a990a", "generation": 1, "timestamp": 1754190714.6363113, "iteration_found": 4, "metrics": {"validity": 0.0, "combined_score": 0.0}, "complexity": 0.0, "diversity": 0.0, "metadata": {"changes": "Full rewrite", "parent_metrics": {"validity": 1.0, "sum_radii": 0.9597642169962064, "target_ratio": 0.36423689449571406, "combined_score": 0.36423689449571406, "eval_time": 1.581624984741211}, "island": 1}, "artifacts_json": "{\"stderr\": \"Stage 1 evaluation failed: Program execution failed: unterminated string literal (detected at line 8) (tmpz1z273pz.py, line 8)\", \"traceback\": \"Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \\\"/workspaces/openevolve/examples/circle_packing_with_artifacts/evaluator.py\\\", line 362, in evaluate_stage1\\n    centers, radii, sum_radii = run_with_timeout(program_path, timeout_seconds=600)\\n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n  File \\\"/workspaces/openevolve/examples/circle_packing_with_artifacts/evaluator.py\\\", line 172, in run_with_timeout\\n    raise RuntimeError(f\\\"Program execution failed: {results['error']}\\\")\\nRuntimeError: Program execution failed: unterminated string literal (detected at line 8) (tmpz1z273pz.py, line 8)\\n\", \"failure_stage\": \"stage1_execution\", \"suggestion\": \"Check basic syntax and imports before attempting full evaluation\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "prompts": {"full_rewrite_user": {"system": "You are an expert mathematician specializing in circle packing problems and computational geometry.

The user wants me to improve the circle packing program for 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of radii. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is around 2.635 as mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper. So there's a big gap here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the current approach isn't achieving that. The existing code places a central circle, then 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But maybe this arrangement isn't optimal. The problem is that the current method uses a simple radial placement, which might not utilize space efficiently, especially near the edges.\n\nThe key insights from the user's notes are about hexagonal packing, edge effects, and varying radii. So maybe a more efficient pattern, like a hexagonal grid, would help. But with 26 circles, how to arrange them? Let's think about typical circle packing arrangements. \n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each layer adds more circles. Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii. Maybe adjusting the clipping or the initial positions can help.\n\nAlso, the compute_max_radii function scales radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this is a greedy approach and might not find the optimal radii. Maybe there's a better way to compute the radii, perhaps using a more systematic method like solving a system of equations for the constraints, but that might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but the user wants an explicit constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598. So maybe that error isn't the main issue here, but it's a bug that needs fixing. So in the new code, I need to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct the circle placement. Let me think of a better arrangement.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid with some layers. For example, arrange circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple rows. For 26 circles, maybe 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. But I need to think of a way to place them.\n\nAlternatively, look at the standard circle packing in a square. For example, for n=26, there might be a known configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of an arrangement that can be constructed manually.\n\nLet me consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at 0.7 radius from the center. That might be too close to the edges. For example, if the center is at 0.5, then adding 0.7 in x direction would take it to 1.2, but then the code clips it to 0.99, which reduces the radius. So maybe the initial positions are not optimal.\n\nAnother idea: use a more efficient arrangement where circles are placed closer to the edges, allowing for larger radii. For example, having circles along the edges, but arranged in a way that they can have larger radii without overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, using a combination of different layers. Maybe a central circle, then a ring around it with 6 circles, then another ring with 12, and so on. Let's see:\n\n- 1 + 6 = 7\n- 1 + 6 + 12 = 19\n- 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 = 37, which is more than 26. So for 26, maybe 1 + 6 + 12 + 7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a square arrangement with some circles in the corners and along the edges. For example, place circles in the four corners, then along the edges, and then in the center.\n\nBut I need to think of a way to place all 26 circles with as much symmetry as possible to maximize the sum of radii.\n\nAlternatively, look at the existing code's structure. It has a central circle, 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But 8 around a central circle is a square ring, which is less dense than a hexagonal ring. Maybe changing the 8 to 6, and adding more layers.\n\nWait, the current code has 8 circles around the center. That would form a square ring, which is not the densest. A hexagonal ring would have 6 circles, but that might not fit with the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 26 circles as 1 in the center, 6 in the first ring, 12 in the second, and 7 in the third. But that adds up to 26. Let's see: 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But how to arrange that?\n\nBut for a hexagonal packing, the first ring around the center has 6 circles. The second ring has 12. Then the third ring would have 18. So 1+6+12=19, then adding 7 would be a partial ring. But that might be messy.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 26 circles as arranged in a way that uses more circles near the edges to utilize the space better.\n\nAnother idea: The current code's outer ring is placed at radius 0.7 from the center. But if the centers are placed closer to the edges, their radii could be larger. For example, if a circle is placed near the corner, its radius can be larger in that direction.\n\nBut how to balance that with overlapping with other circles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial positions are too spread out. For example, the central circle is at (0.5, 0.5). The 8 surrounding circles are at radius 0.3 from the center. That's 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 in x and y, so positions like 0.8, 0.5, etc. But then the outer ring is at 0.7 from the center. So 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2, which is clipped to 0.99, so the actual distance from the center is 0.49. Wait, that's a problem. The outer ring's centers are placed at 0.7 from the center, but then they are clipped to 0.99, which reduces their distance from the edge. That would make their maximum radius smaller than possible.\n\nSo maybe the initial positions are not optimal. For example, placing the outer ring's circles closer to the edges.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible radius for circles near the edges. For example, a circle placed at (0.5, 0.1) would have a maximum radius of 0.1 (distance to the bottom edge). But if it's placed closer to the center, say (0.5, 0.3), then the radius is limited by the distance to the bottom (0.3) and the distance to other circles.\n\nSo perhaps a better strategy is to have circles placed in a way that their proximity to the edges and other circles allows for larger radii.\n\nBut how to design that manually?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the known result from AlphaEvolve. They achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26. The current code's sum is 0.9598, which is way lower. So there's a huge gap. That suggests that the current approach is not even close to optimal.\n\nSo the problem is that the current code's arrangement is not efficient. The initial placement is probably not optimal. So I need to find a better arrangement.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to look for a known configuration or to use a more efficient pattern.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635. So I need to replicate that configuration, but since I can't refer to the paper, I need to think of a way to design a better arrangement.\n\nAnother idea: Use a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let's say:\n\n- 1 circle in the center.\n\n- 6 circles around it, forming the first ring.\n\n- 12 circles in the second ring.\n\n- 7 circles in a third ring (partial).\n\nBut how to place these in a square? Let's think of coordinates.\n\nFor the first ring (6 circles) around the center (0.5, 0.5), their positions would be at a distance r from the center. The distance between adjacent circles in a hexagonal ring is 2r*sin(\u03c0/6) = r. Wait, no, the distance between centers of adjacent circles in a hexagonal ring is 2r, where r is the radius of the circles. But since the circles can't overlap, the distance between centers should be at least 2r. But in the initial code, the circles are placed at a certain distance from the center, which may not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, for the first ring, if the central circle has radius R, then the surrounding 6 circles must be placed at a distance of 2R from the center. So their centers are at (0.5 + 2R*cos(theta), 0.5 + 2R*sin(theta)) for theta = 0, 60, 120, etc. Then, the radius of these surrounding circles can be limited by their proximity to the edges and to each other.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to design the positions of the circles in a way that maximizes their radii, considering both the distance to the edges and to other circles.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each circle is a node, and edges represent constraints (distance between centers must be at least sum of radii). Then, the problem is to assign positions and radii to maximize the sum of radii, subject to these constraints. However, solving this analytically is complex, but for a specific configuration, it might be possible to find a good arrangement.\n\nBut since the user wants a constructor function that directly places each circle, I need to find an explicit arrangement.\n\nAnother thought: The current code's outer ring is placed at a radius of 0.7 from the center, but that's probably too large, causing the circles to be clipped near the edges. So maybe reducing that radius to allow for larger radii without clipping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial positions are not optimal. For example, placing circles in a hexagonal pattern closer to the edges.\n\nBut without knowing the exact configuration from AlphaEvolve, it's challenging. However, I can try to design a more efficient arrangement based on known principles.\n\nLet me consider that the optimal packing for 26 circles would have multiple layers. For example:\n\n- 1 circle in the center.\n\n- 6 circles around it (first ring).\n\n- 12 circles in the second ring.\n\n- 7 circles in a third ring (but this might not be a full ring).\n\nBut how to position these in a square.\n\nLet me try to calculate coordinates for such a configuration.\n\nAssuming the central circle is at (0.5, 0.5). The first ring has 6 circles placed at a distance d1 from the center. The second ring has 12 circles placed at a distance d2 from the center. The third ring has 7 circles.\n\nBut the positions need to be such that the circles don't overlap and are within the square.\n\nLet me think about the distances between the circles. For the first ring (6 circles), each is separated by 60 degrees. The distance between adjacent circles in the first ring would be 2d1 * sin(\u03c0/6) = d1. Wait, the distance between two adjacent circles in the first ring would be 2 * d1 * sin(\u03c0/6) = d1. Since each circle must be at least 2r1 apart from each other, where r1 is the radius of the first ring circles. But if the central circle has radius R, then the distance from the center to the first ring circles is R + r1. So d1 = R + r1.\n\nBut also, the distance between adjacent first ring circles is 2r1. Because they can't overlap. So the distance between two adjacent circles in the first ring is 2r1. But from earlier, this distance is d1 * sqrt(3) (wait, no, let me think again).\n\nWait, for two adjacent circles in a ring around the center: the angle between them is 60 degrees. The distance between their centers is 2d1 * sin(\u03c0/6) = 2d1 * 0.5 = d1. So this distance must be >= 2r1. Therefore, d1 >= 2r1. Also, since the central circle has radius R, and the first ring circles have radius r1, the distance between the center and the first ring circles is R + r1 = d1. Therefore, d1 = R + r1. Combining these, R + r1 >= 2r1 => R >= r1. So the central circle must be at least as large as the first ring circles.\n\nBut this may not be optimal. Maybe having the central circle smaller allows for larger radii overall. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume all circles have the same radius. Then, the distance from the center to the first ring circles would be 2r, and the distance between adjacent first ring circles is also 2r, which fits. But then the central circle would have to have radius r, and the distance from the center to the first ring circles is 2r. But this would require that the first ring circles are placed at 2r from the center. However, the square's edge would limit the maximum possible r. For example, if the first ring circles are placed at a distance of 2r from the center, then the distance from the center to the edge of the square is 0.5. So 2r + r = 3r <= 0.5 => r <= 0.5/3 \u2248 0.1667. Then, the total sum of radii would be 1*r + 6*r + 12*r = 19r \u2248 3.1667, which is higher than the current sum. But this is assuming all circles have the same radius, which may not be optimal. However, this suggests that the current approach of varying radii may not be the best.\n\nBut this is just a hypothetical scenario. In reality, varying radii may allow for better packing.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to design a more efficient configuration.\n\nLet me try to create a configuration with multiple layers, but with more circles near the edges.\n\nFor example, place circles in the corners, along the edges, and in the center. For 26 circles, maybe:\n\n- 4 circles in the corners, each near a corner. Their positions would be (0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.9), (0.9, 0.1), (0.9, 0.9). Each of these can have a radius of 0.1 (distance to the nearest edge).\n\n- Then, along the edges, place circles between the corners. For example, on the bottom edge, between (0.1, 0.1) and (0.9, 0.1), place 3 circles. Similarly on the other edges. That would add 3*4 = 12 circles, totaling 4 + 12 = 16 circles.\n\n- Then, in the center, place a ring of 6 circles, and one in the center. That would be 1 + 6 = 7, totaling 16 + 7 = 23 circles. Need 3 more.\n\nHmm, this is getting messy. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square divided into regions, with circles placed in each region.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here. Perhaps the key issue is the initial arrangement in the current code, which is not efficient. So to improve, I need to find a better arrangement.\n\nLet me think of the following steps for the new code:\n\n1. Correct the circle placement to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed. In the current code, one circle is not placed, leading to a zero radius, which is a bug. So in the new code, I need to ensure all circles are placed.\n\n2. Use a more efficient arrangement, possibly with hexagonal packing or other patterns that maximize the use of space.\n\n3. Adjust the compute_max_radii function to better handle the constraints, possibly by using a more accurate method to calculate radii.\n\nBut since the"]}}}
