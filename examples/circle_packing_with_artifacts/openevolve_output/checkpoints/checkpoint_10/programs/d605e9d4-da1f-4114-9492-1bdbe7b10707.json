{"id": "d605e9d4-da1f-4114-9492-1bdbe7b10707", "code": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the circle packing program for 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of radii. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is around 2.635 as mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper. So there's a big gap here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the current approach isn't achieving that. The existing code places a central circle, then 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But maybe this arrangement isn't optimal. The problem is that the current method uses a simple radial placement, which might not utilize space efficiently, especially near the edges.\n\nThe key insights from the user's notes are about hexagonal packing, edge effects, and varying radii. So maybe a more efficient pattern, like a hexagonal grid, would help. But with 26 circles, how to arrange them? Let's think about typical circle packing arrangements. \n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each layer adds more circles. Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii. Maybe adjusting the clipping or the initial positions can help.\n\nAlso, the compute_max_radii function scales radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this is a greedy approach and might not find the optimal radii. Maybe there's a better way to compute the radii, perhaps using a more systematic method like solving a system of equations for the constraints, but that might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but the user wants an explicit constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598. So maybe that error isn't the main issue here, but it's a bug that needs fixing. So in the new code, I need to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct the circle placement. Let me think of a better arrangement.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid with some layers. For example, arrange circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple rows. For 26 circles, maybe 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. But I need to think of a way to place them.\n\nAlternatively, look at the standard circle packing in a square. For example, for n=26, there might be a known configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of an arrangement that can be constructed manually.\n\nLet me consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at a radius of 0.7 from the center. However, since the square has sides of length 1, placing circles at 0.7 radius from the center might make them too close to the edges. For example, the center is at (0.5, 0.5). A circle placed at (0.5 + 0.7*cos(theta), 0.5 + 0.7*sin(theta)) would have coordinates that could be up to 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2, which is outside the square. Hence, the code clips them to 0.99, which reduces their radii. So maybe the outer ring's radius is too large, causing the clipping and reducing the possible radii.\n\nSo perhaps adjusting the positions of the outer circles to be closer to the center, allowing for larger radii without clipping.\n\nAnother idea: instead of placing circles in a single ring, maybe use multiple concentric rings with varying radii, ensuring that all circles are within the square and have sufficient space between them.\n\nAlternatively, use a more efficient pattern where circles are arranged in a hexagonal grid but adjusted to fit into the square. For example, arrange the circles in a grid with rows offset by half the circle diameter, but adjusted so that they fit within the square.\n\nBut how to translate that into code?\n\nAlternatively, look for existing known configurations. For example, in the literature, for n=26, the optimal packing might have a certain structure. However, without specific knowledge, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me think of a possible arrangement. Suppose we have a central circle, then a ring of 6 circles around it, then another ring of 12 circles, and maybe some more. Wait, 1 + 6 + 12 = 19. Then adding another 7 circles? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into regions. For example, four corners with clusters, and some along the edges.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of layers. Let me try to think of a way to place 26 circles in a more optimal way.\n\nAnother approach: instead of using a fixed radius for each ring, calculate the positions based on the desired spacing. For example, if circles are placed in a hexagonal grid, the distance between centers should be at least twice the radius (assuming all circles have the same radius). However, since the radii might vary, this complicates things.\n\nBut the current code uses a compute_max_radii function which scales the radii based on the distances between centers. However, this might not be optimal because scaling is done pairwise, which could lead to suboptimal radii for some circles.\n\nSo, perhaps a better way is to design the positions in such a way that the minimal distance between any two centers is maximized, allowing for larger radii. This is essentially the circle packing problem where you want to maximize the minimum radius, but here the goal is to maximize the sum of radii, which may involve varying radii.\n\nBut since the user wants an explicit constructor, not an algorithm that iteratively optimizes, I need to come up with a specific arrangement.\n\nLet me consider that the current code's main issue is the inefficient placement of circles. For example, the outer ring is too far from the center, leading to clipping and thus smaller radii. Let me try to adjust that.\n\nLet me think of a different configuration. Suppose I have multiple concentric rings. For example, the first ring (center) has 1 circle, the second ring has 6, the third has 12, and the fourth has 7. That totals 1+6+12+7=26. But how to arrange them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more balanced approach. Let me try to create a structure where the circles are placed in a hexagonal pattern, with positions calculated such that they fit within the square and have sufficient spacing.\n\nFor example, for a hexagonal grid, each circle is placed at positions (i + 0.5*j, j*sqrt(3)/2), but adjusted to fit into the square. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use a more empirical approach. Let's say the current code has a central circle, 8 surrounding it (which is more than a hexagonal ring of 6), and then 16 in the outer ring. But maybe that's not optimal. Let's think of a better way to arrange 26 circles.\n\nAnother thought: the current code's outer ring has 16 circles. Placing 16 circles in a ring around the center would require them to be spaced every 22.5 degrees (since 360/16=22.5). But this might lead to a larger radius for the outer ring, causing clipping. Instead, perhaps using a smaller radius for the outer ring, allowing for larger radii.\n\nLet me try adjusting the code to place the outer ring at a smaller radius. For example, instead of 0.7, maybe 0.4 or 0.5. Let's see. The center is at (0.5, 0.5). If the outer ring is placed at a radius r from the center, then the maximum distance from the square's edge would be 0.5 - (0.5 + r) = 0.5 - (0.5 + r) = -r? Wait, no. The distance from the center to the edge is 0.5 units. So if a circle is placed at a distance d from the center, then its maximum radius is limited by the distance to the square's edge. For example, if the circle is at (0.5 + d*cos(theta), 0.5 + d*sin(theta)), then the distance to the nearest edge is min(0.5 - d*cos(theta), 0.5 - d*sin(theta), 0.5 - (1 - (0.5 + d*cos(theta)))), etc. This is getting complex, but perhaps placing the outer ring at a smaller radius would allow for larger radii.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial positions are not optimal. For example, the current code's outer ring is placed at 0.7 from the center, but that's too far. Let's try placing the outer ring at a smaller radius. Let's say 0.4. Then, the circles would be placed at 0.5 + 0.4*cos(theta), etc. Then, the distance from the square's edge would be 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1, which would limit the radius to 0.1. That's small, but maybe better than the current approach.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a more efficient arrangement where circles are closer together but with varying radii. For example, some circles near the edges can be smaller, allowing others in the center to be larger.\n\nBut how to model that in code?\n\nAnother idea: instead of having all circles in rings, use a more compact arrangement. For example, two layers of hexagonal packing. Let's say the first layer has 7 circles (1 center and 6 around it), the second layer has 19 circles. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into regions. For example, four quadrants, each with a cluster of circles. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, look at the problem from the perspective of the AlphaEvolve paper. They achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26. That's a much higher sum than the current 0.9598. So the current code is way off. This suggests that the current approach is very suboptimal. Therefore, the initial placement of circles is not good, and the compute_max_radii function is not effective.\n\nSo, the main problem is the initial placement of the circles. The current code's arrangement is too simplistic and inefficient. Therefore, the solution must involve a better initial arrangement of the circles.\n\nLet me try to think of a better arrangement. For example, in the AlphaEvolve paper, they might have used a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let me try to create a hexagonal grid with multiple layers.\n\nFor example, in a hexagonal grid, each layer has 6n circles, where n is the layer number. So layer 0 has 1 circle (center), layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles:\n\n1 (layer 0) + 6 (layer 1) + 12 (layer 2) = 19. Then, layer 3 has 18, but we need 26-19=7 more. So maybe 7 circles in a partial layer.\n\nBut how to arrange these in the square? Let me think of the positions.\n\nEach circle in layer k is placed at a distance of k * (2r) from the center, where r is the radius of the circles. But since the circles can have varying radii, this complicates things. However, assuming all circles have the same radius, the distance between centers would be 2r. But since the goal is to maximize the sum of radii, perhaps varying radii would allow for a better packing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a combination of layers with different radii. For example, the central circle is larger, then the surrounding ones are smaller, allowing for tighter packing.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me try to implement a more structured approach.\n\nLet me think of the following arrangement:\n\n- One central circle.\n- A first ring of 6 circles around it.\n- A second ring of 12 circles.\n- A third ring of 7 circles.\n\nTotal 1+6+12+7=26. Now, how to place these in the square.\n\nThe central circle is at (0.5, 0.5). The first ring of 6 circles would be placed at a distance of d1 from the center. The second ring at distance d2, and the third at d3. The positions need to be calculated such that they don't exceed the square's boundaries.\n\nBut how to determine d1, d2, d3? Also, the radii of the circles would be limited by the distance to their neighbors and to the square's edges.\n\nLet me try to calculate these distances.\n\nAssuming all circles have the same radius r, the distance between the center and the first ring would be 2r (since the circles touch each other). Similarly, the distance between the first and second ring would be 2r. The distance between the second and third ring would be 2r. But this is for equal radii. However, if the radii vary, this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that all circles have the same radius, then the positions can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor the first ring (6 circles), their centers are at a distance of 2r from the center. For the second ring (12 circles), the distance from the center would be 4r, since each subsequent layer adds another 2r. The third ring would be at 6r.\n\nNow, the maximum distance from the center to any circle's center is 6r. Since the square has side length 1, the distance from the center to the edge is 0.5. So, 6r + r (the radius of the outermost circle) must be \u2264 0.5. Wait, no. The distance from the center to the edge of the square is 0.5. The distance from the center to the center of the outermost circle is 6r. Then, the radius of that outer circle must be such that 6r + r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 7r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 r \u2264 0.5/7 \u2248 0.0714. That's very small. But this is assuming all circles have the same radius, which might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, if the outer circles have smaller radii, allowing the inner ones to have larger radii. This is the approach used in the AlphaEvolve paper, perhaps.\n\nBut how to model this in code without iterative optimization?\n\nThis is tricky. Another approach is to look for known optimal configurations for n=26. Since I can't look it up, I need to think of a plausible arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the current code's sum is 0.9598, which is way below the target of 2.635. This suggests that the current arrangement is very inefficient. Therefore, the main issue is the initial placement of circles, which is not optimal.\n\nLet me try to create a more efficient arrangement. For example, instead of placing 8 circles around the center, use a hexagonal ring of 6, then another ring of 12, and a third ring of 7, totaling 26. Let's try that.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the new construct_packing function:\n\n1. Place the central circle at (0.5, 0.5).\n2. Place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring. The distance from the center to each of these is d1.\n3. Place 12 circles in the next ring, with distance d2 from the center.\n4. Place 7 circles in the third ring, with distance d3 from the center.\n\nBut how to calculate d1, d2, d3 to ensure the circles fit within the square and don't overlap.\n\nAssuming all circles have the same radius r, then:\n\n- Between the central circle and the first ring: distance between centers is 2r (they touch).\n- Between the first ring and the second ring: distance between centers is 2r (they touch).\n- Between the second ring and the third ring: distance between centers is 2r.\n\nThe maximum distance from the center to the outermost circle's center is d3 + r (since the outer circle's radius is r). This must be \u2264 0.5 (distance from center to square edge). So:\n\nd3 + r \u2264 0.5\n\nAlso, d3 = 4r (since each ring adds 2r). So:\n\n4r + r = 5r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 r \u2264 0.1.\n\nThat's still", "language": "python", "parent_id": "3b1cbe6a-ace0-42cd-a269-5865c6e8bc6b", "generation": 2, "timestamp": 1754190867.8783798, "iteration_found": 9, "metrics": {"validity": 0.0, "combined_score": 0.0}, "complexity": 0.0, "diversity": 0.0, "metadata": {"changes": "Full rewrite", "parent_metrics": {"validity": 0.0, "combined_score": 0.0}, "island": 0}, "artifacts_json": "{\"stderr\": \"Stage 1 evaluation failed: Program execution failed: unterminated string literal (detected at line 8) (tmpq7brgbmz.py, line 8)\", \"traceback\": \"Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \\\"/workspaces/openevolve/examples/circle_packing_with_artifacts/evaluator.py\\\", line 362, in evaluate_stage1\\n    centers, radii, sum_radii = run_with_timeout(program_path, timeout_seconds=600)\\n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n  File \\\"/workspaces/openevolve/examples/circle_packing_with_artifacts/evaluator.py\\\", line 172, in run_with_timeout\\n    raise RuntimeError(f\\\"Program execution failed: {results['error']}\\\")\\nRuntimeError: Program execution failed: unterminated string literal (detected at line 8) (tmpq7brgbmz.py, line 8)\\n\", \"failure_stage\": \"stage1_execution\", \"suggestion\": \"Check basic syntax and imports before attempting full evaluation\"}", "artifact_dir": null, "prompts": {"full_rewrite_user": {"system": "You are an expert mathematician specializing in circle packing problems and computational geometry.

The user wants me to improve the circle packing program for 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of radii. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is around 2.635 as mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper. So there's a big gap here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the current approach isn't achieving that. The existing code places a central circle, then 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But maybe this arrangement isn't optimal. The problem is that the current method uses a simple radial placement, which might not utilize space efficiently, especially near the edges.\n\nThe key insights from the user's notes are about hexagonal packing, edge effects, and varying radii. So maybe a more efficient pattern, like a hexagonal grid, would help. But with 26 circles, how to arrange them? Let's think about typical circle packing arrangements. \n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each layer adds more circles. Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii.

So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598. So maybe that error isn't the main issue here, but it's a bug that needs fixing. So in the new code, I need to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct the circle placement. Let me think of a better arrangement.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid with some layers. For example, arrange circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple rows. For 26 circles, maybe 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. But I need to think of a way to place them.\n\nAlternatively, look at the standard circle packing in a square. For example, for n=26, there might be a known configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of an arrangement that can be constructed manually.\n\nLet me consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at a radius of 0.7 from the center. However, since the square has sides of length 1, placing circles at 0.7 radius from the center might make them too close to the edges. For example, the center is at (0.5, 0.5). A circle placed at (0.5 + 0.7*cos(theta), 0.5 + 0.7*sin(theta)) would have coordinates that could be up to 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2, which is outside the square. Hence, the code clips them to 0.99, which reduces their radii. So maybe the outer ring's radius is too large, causing the clipping and reducing the possible radii.\n\nSo perhaps adjusting the positions of the outer circles to be closer to the center, allowing for larger radii without clipping.\n\nAnother idea: instead of placing circles in a single ring, maybe use multiple concentric rings with varying radii, ensuring that all circles are within the square and have sufficient space between them.\n\nAlternatively, use a more efficient pattern where circles are arranged in a hexagonal grid but adjusted to fit into the square. For example, arrange the circles in a grid with rows offset by half the circle diameter, but adjusted so that they fit within the square.\n\nBut how to translate that into code?\n\nAlternatively, look for existing known configurations. For example, in the literature, for n=26, the optimal packing might have a certain structure. However, without specific knowledge, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me think of a possible arrangement. Suppose we have a central circle, then a ring of 6 circles around it, then another ring of 12 circles, and maybe some more. Wait, 1 + 6 + 12 = 19. Then adding another 7 circles? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into regions. For example, four corners with clusters, and some along the edges.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of layers. Let me try to think of a way to place 26 circles in a more optimal way.\n\nAnother approach: instead of using a fixed radius for each ring, calculate the positions based on the desired spacing. For example, if circles are placed in a hexagonal grid, the distance between centers should be at least twice the radius (assuming all circles have the same radius). However, since the radii might vary, this complicates things.\n\nBut the current code uses a compute_max_radii function which scales the radii based on the distances between centers. However, this might not be optimal because scaling is done pairwise, which could lead to suboptimal radii for some circles.\n\nSo, perhaps a better way is to design the positions in such a way that the minimal distance between any two centers is maximized, allowing for larger radii. This is essentially the circle packing problem where you want to maximize the minimum radius, but here the goal is to maximize the sum of radii, which may involve varying radii.\n\nBut since the user wants an explicit constructor, not an algorithm that iteratively optimizes, I need to come up with a specific arrangement.\n\nLet me consider that the current code's main issue is the inefficient placement of circles. For example, the outer ring is too far from the center, leading to clipping and thus smaller radii. Let me try to adjust that.\n\nLet me think of a different configuration. Suppose I have multiple concentric rings. For example, the first ring (center) has 1 circle, the second ring has 6, the third has 12, and the fourth has 7. That totals 1+6+12+7=26. But how to arrange them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more balanced approach. Let me try to create a structure where the circles are placed in a hexagonal pattern, with positions calculated such that they fit within the square and have sufficient spacing.\n\nFor example, for a hexagonal grid, each circle is placed at positions (i + 0.5*j, j*sqrt(3)/2), but adjusted to fit into the square. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use a more empirical approach. Let's say the current code has a central circle, 8 surrounding it (which is more than a hexagonal ring of 6), and then 16 in the outer ring. But maybe that's not optimal. Let's think of a better way to arrange 26 circles.\n\nAnother thought: the current code's outer ring has 16 circles. Placing 16 circles in a ring around the center would require them to be spaced every 22.5 degrees (since 360/16=22.5). But this might lead to a larger radius for the outer ring, causing clipping. Instead, perhaps using a smaller radius for the outer ring, allowing for larger radii.\n\nLet me try adjusting the code to place the outer ring at a smaller radius. For example, instead of 0.7, maybe 0.4 or 0.5. Let's see. The center is at (0.5, 0.5). If the outer ring is placed at a radius r from the center, then the maximum distance from the square's edge would be 0.5 - (0.5 + r) = 0.5 - (0.5 + r) = -r? Wait, no. The distance from the center to the edge is 0.5 units. So if a circle is placed at a distance d from the center, then its maximum radius is limited by the distance to the square's edge. For example, if the circle is at (0.5 + d*cos(theta), 0.5 + d*sin(theta)), then the distance to the nearest edge is min(0.5 - d*cos(theta), 0.5 - d*sin(theta), 0.5 - (1 - (0.5 + d*cos(theta)))), etc. This is getting complex, but perhaps placing the outer ring at a smaller radius would allow for larger radii.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial positions are not optimal. For example, the current code's outer ring is placed at 0.7 from the center, but that's too far. Let's try placing the outer ring at a smaller radius. Let's say 0.4. Then, the circles would be placed at 0.5 + 0.4*cos(theta), etc. Then, the distance from the square's edge would be 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1, which would limit the radius to 0.1. That's small, but maybe better than the current approach.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a more efficient arrangement where circles are closer together but with varying radii. For example, some circles near the edges can be smaller, allowing others in the center to be larger.\n\nBut how to model that in code?\n\nAnother idea: instead of having all circles in rings, use a more compact arrangement. For example, two layers of hexagonal packing. Let's say the first layer has 7 circles (1 center and 6 around it), the second layer has 19 circles. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into regions. For example, four quadrants, each with a cluster of circles. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, look at the problem from the perspective of the AlphaEvolve paper. They achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26. That's a much higher sum than the current 0.9598. So the current code is way off. This suggests that the current approach is very suboptimal. Therefore, the initial placement of circles is not good, and the compute_max_radii function is not effective.\n\nSo, the main problem is the initial placement of the circles. The current code's arrangement is too simplistic and inefficient. Therefore, the solution must involve a better initial arrangement of the circles.\n\nLet me try to think of a better arrangement. For example, in the AlphaEvolve paper, they might have used a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let me try to create a hexagonal grid with multiple layers.\n\nFor example, in a hexagonal grid, each layer has 6n circles, where n is the layer number. So layer 0 has 1 circle (center), layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles:\n\n1 (layer 0) + 6 (layer 1) + 12 (layer 2) = 19. Then, layer 3 has 18, but we need 26-19=7 more. So maybe 7 circles in a partial layer.\n\nBut how to arrange these in the square? Let me think of the positions.\n\nEach circle in layer k is placed at a distance of k * (2r) from the center, where r is the radius of the circles. But since the circles can have varying radii, this complicates things. However, assuming all circles have the same radius, the distance between centers would be 2r. But since the goal is to maximize the sum of radii, perhaps varying radii would allow for a better packing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a combination of layers with different radii. For example, the central circle is larger, then the surrounding ones are smaller, allowing for tighter packing.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me try to implement a more structured approach.\n\nLet me think of the following arrangement:\n\n- One central circle.\n- A first ring of 6 circles around it.\n- A second ring of 12 circles.\n- A third ring of 7 circles.\n\nTotal 1+6+12+7=26. Now, how to place these in the square.\n\nThe central circle is at (0.5, 0.5). The first ring of 6 circles would be placed at a distance of d1 from the center. The second ring at distance d2, and the third at d3. The positions need to be calculated such that they don't exceed the square's boundaries.\n\nBut how to determine d1, d2, d3? Also, the radii of the circles would be limited by the distance to their neighbors and to the square's edges.\n\nLet me try to calculate these distances.\n\nAssuming all circles have the same radius r, the distance between the center and the first ring would be 2r (since the circles touch each other). Similarly, the distance between the first and second ring would be 2r. The distance between the second and third ring would be 2r. But this is for equal radii. However, if the radii vary, this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that all circles have the same radius, then the positions can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor the first ring (6 circles), their centers are at a distance of 2r from the center. For the second ring (12 circles), the distance from the center would be 4r, since each subsequent layer adds another 2r. The third ring would be at 6r.\n\nNow, the maximum distance from the center to any circle's center is 6r. Since the square has side length 1, the distance from the center to the edge is 0.5. So, 6r + r (the radius of the outermost circle) must be \u2264 0.5. Wait, no. The distance from the center to the edge of the square is 0.5. The distance from the center to the center of the outermost circle is 6r. Then, the radius of that outer circle must be such that 6r + r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 7r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 r \u2264 0.5/7 \u2248 0.0714. That's very small. But this is assuming all circles have the same radius, which might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, if the outer circles have smaller radii, allowing the inner ones to have larger radii. This is the approach used in the AlphaEvolve paper, perhaps.\n\nBut how to model this in code without iterative optimization?\n\nThis is tricky. Another approach is to look for known optimal configurations for n=26. Since I can't look it up, I need to think of a plausible arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the current code's sum is 0.9598, which is way below the target of 2.635. This suggests that the current arrangement is very inefficient. Therefore, the main issue is the initial placement of circles, which is not optimal.\n\nLet me try to create a more efficient arrangement. For example, instead of placing 8 circles around the center, use a hexagonal ring of 6, then another ring of 12, and a third ring of 7, totaling 26. Let's try that.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the new construct_packing function:\n\n1. Place the central circle at (0.5, 0.5).\n2. Place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring. The distance from the center to each of these is d1.\n3. Place 12 circles in the next ring, with distance d2 from the center.\n4. Place 7 circles in the third ring, with distance d3 from the center.\n\nBut how to calculate d1, d2, d3 to ensure the circles fit within the square and don't overlap.\n\nAssuming all circles have the same radius r, then:\n\n- Between the central circle and the first ring: distance between centers is 2r (they touch).\n- Between the first ring and the second ring: distance between centers is 2r (they touch).\n- Between the second ring and the third ring: distance between centers is 2r.\n\nThe maximum distance from the center to the outermost circle's center is d3 + r (since the outer circle's radius is r). This must be \u2264 0.5 (distance from center to square edge). So:\n\nd3 + r \u2264 0.5\n\nAlso, d3 = 4r (since each ring adds 2r). So:\n\n4r + r = 5r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 r \u2264 0.1.\n\nThat's still\n```\nKey features: Performs well on validity (0.0000), Performs well on combined_score (0.0000)\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.8540, Type: High-Performer)\n```python\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START\n\"\"\"Constructor-based circle packing for n=26 circles\"\"\"\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef construct_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Construct a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square\n    that attempts to maximize the sum of their radii.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (centers, radii, sum_of_radii)\n        centers: np.array of shape (26, 2) with (x, y) coordinates\n        radii: np.array of shape (26) with radius of each circle\n        sum_of_radii: Sum of all radii\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize arrays for 26 circles\n    n = 26\n    centers = np.zeros((n, 2))\n\n    # Place circles in a structured pattern\n    # This is a simple pattern - evolution will improve this\n\n    # First, place a large circle in the center\n    centers[0] = [0.5, 0.5]\n\n    # Place 8 circles around it in a ring\n    for i in range(8):\n        angle = 2 * np.pi * i / 8\n        centers[i + 1] = [0.5 + 0.3 * np.cos(angle), 0.5 + 0.3 * np.sin(angle)]\n\n    # Place 16 more circles in an outer ring\n    for i in range(16):\n        angle = 2 * np.pi * i / 16\n        centers[i + 9] = [0.5 + 0.7 * np.cos(angle), 0.5 + 0.7 * np.sin(angle)]\n\n    # Additional positioning adjustment to make sure all circles\n    # are inside the square and don't overlap\n    # Clip to ensure everything is inside the unit square\n    centers = np.clip(centers, 0.01, 0.99)\n\n    # Compute maximum valid radii for this configuration\n    radii = compute_max_radii(centers)\n\n    # Calculate the sum of radii\n    sum_radii = np.sum(radii)\n\n    return centers, radii, sum_radii\n\n\ndef compute_max_radii(centers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the maximum possible radii for each circle position\n    such that they don't overlap and stay within the unit square.\n\n    Args:\n        centers: np.array of shape (n, 2) with (x, y) coordinates\n\n    Returns:\n        np.array of shape (n) with radius of each circle\n    \"\"\"\n    n = centers.shape[0]\n    radii = np.ones(n)\n\n    # First, limit by distance to square borders\n    for i in range(n):\n        x, y = centers[i]\n        # Distance to borders\n        radii[i] = min(x, y, 1 - x, 1 - y)\n\n    # Then, limit by distance to other circles\n    # Each pair of circles with centers at distance d can have\n    # sum of radii at most d to avoid overlap\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            dist = np.sqrt(np.sum((centers[i] - centers[j]) ** 2))\n\n            # If current radii would cause overlap\n            if radii[i] + radii[j] > dist:\n                # Scale both radii proportionally\n                scale = dist / (radii[i] + radii[j])\n                radii[i] *= scale\n                radii[j] *= scale\n\n    return radii\n\n\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n\n\n# This part remains fixed (not evolved)\ndef run_packing():\n    \"\"\"Run the circle packing constructor for n=26\"\"\"\n    centers, radii, sum_radii = construct_packing()\n    return centers, radii, sum_radii\n\n\ndef visualize(centers, radii):\n    \"\"\"\n    Visualize the circle packing\n\n    Args:\n        centers: np.array of shape (n, 2) with (x, y) coordinates\n        radii: np.array of shape (n) with radius of each circle\n    \"\"\"\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    from matplotlib.patches import Circle\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))\n\n    # Draw unit square\n    ax.set_xlim(0, 1)\n    ax.set_ylim(0, 1)\n    ax.set_aspect(\"equal\")\n    ax.grid(True)\n\n    # Draw circles\n    for i, (center, radius) in enumerate(zip(centers, radii)):\n        circle = Circle(center, radius, alpha=0.5)\n        ax.add_patch(circle)\n        ax.text(center[0], center[1], str(i), ha=\"center\", va=\"center\")\n\n    plt.title(f\"Circle Packing (n={len(centers)}, sum={sum(radii):.6f})\")\n    plt.show()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    centers, radii, sum_radii = run_packing()\n    print(f\"Sum of radii: {sum_radii}\")\n    # AlphaEvolve improved this to 2.635\n\n    # Uncomment to visualize:\n    visualize(centers, radii)\n\n```\nUnique approach: Excellent validity (1.000), Excellent sum_radii (0.960), Excellent eval_time (1.582)\n\n\n\n# Current Program\n```python\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the circle packing program for 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of radii. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is around 2.635 as mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper. So there's a big gap here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the current approach isn't achieving that. The existing code places a central circle, then 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But maybe this arrangement isn't optimal. The problem is that the current method uses a simple radial placement, which might not utilize space efficiently, especially near the edges.\n\nThe key insights from the user's notes are about hexagonal packing, edge effects, and varying radii. So maybe a more efficient pattern, like a hexagonal grid, would help. But with 26 circles, how to arrange them? Let's think about typical circle packing arrangements. \n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each layer adds more circles. Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii. Maybe adjusting the clipping or the initial positions can help.\n\nAlso, the compute_max_radii function scales radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this is a greedy approach and might not find the optimal radii. Maybe there's a better way to compute the radii, perhaps using a more systematic method like solving a system of equations for the constraints, but that might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but the user wants an explicit constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598.

A circle placed at (0.5 + 0.7*cos(theta), 0.5 + 0.7*sin(theta)) would have coordinates that could be up to 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2, which is outside the square. Hence, the code clips them to 0.99, which reduces their radii. So maybe the outer ring's radius is too large, causing the clipping and reducing the possible radii.\n\nSo perhaps adjusting the positions of the outer circles to be closer to the center, allowing for larger radii without clipping.\n\nAnother idea: instead of placing circles in a single ring, maybe use multiple concentric rings with varying radii, ensuring that all circles are within the square and have sufficient space between them.\n\nAlternatively, use a more efficient pattern where circles are arranged in a hexagonal grid but adjusted to fit into the square.

Let's think of a better way to arrange 26 circles.\n\nAnother thought: the current code's outer ring has 16 circles. Placing 16 circles in a ring around the center would require them to be spaced every 22.5 degrees (since 360/16=22.5). But this might lead to a larger radius for the outer ring, causing clipping. Instead, perhaps using a smaller radius for the outer ring, allowing for larger radii.\n\nLet me try adjusting the code to place the outer ring at a smaller radius. For example, instead of 0.7, maybe 0.4 or 0.5. Let's see. The center is at (0.5, 0.5). If the outer ring is placed at a radius r from the center, then the maximum distance from the square's edge would be 0.5 - (0.5 + r) = 0.5 - (0.5 + r) = -r? Wait, no. The distance from the center to the edge is 0.5 units. So if a circle is placed at a distance d from the center, then its maximum radius is limited by the distance to the square's edge. For example, if the circle is at (0.5 + d*cos(theta), 0.5 + d*sin(theta)), then the distance to the nearest edge is min(0.5 - d*cos(theta), 0.5 - d*sin(theta), 0.5 - (1 - (0.5 + d*cos(theta)))), etc. This is getting complex, but perhaps placing the outer ring at a smaller radius would allow for larger radii.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial positions are not optimal. For example, the current code's outer ring is placed at 0.7 from the center, but that's too far. Let's try placing the outer ring at a smaller radius. Let's say 0.4. Then, the circles would be placed at 0.5 + 0.4*cos(theta), etc. Then, the distance from the square's edge would be 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1, which would limit the radius to 0.1. That's small, but maybe better than the current approach.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a more efficient arrangement where circles are closer together but with varying radii. For example, some circles near the edges can be smaller, allowing others in the center to be larger.\n\nBut how to model that in code?\n\nAnother idea: instead of having all circles in rings, use a more compact arrangement. For example, two layers of hexagonal packing. Let's say the first layer has 7 circles (1 center and 6 around it), the second layer has 19 circles. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into regions. For example, four quadrants, each with a cluster of circles. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, look at the problem from the perspective of the AlphaEvolve paper. They achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26. That's a much higher sum than the current 0.9598. So the current code is way off. This suggests that the current approach is very suboptimal. Therefore, the initial placement of circles is not good, and the compute_max_radii function is not effective.\n\nSo, the main problem is the initial placement of the circles. The current code's arrangement is too simplistic and inefficient. Therefore, the solution must involve a better initial arrangement of the circles.\n\nLet me try to think of a better arrangement. For example, in the AlphaEvolve paper, they might have used a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let me try to create a hexagonal grid with multiple layers.\n\nFor example, in a hexagonal grid, each layer has 6n circles, where n is the layer number. So layer 0 has 1 circle (center), layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles:\n\n1 (layer 0) + 6 (layer 1) + 12 (layer 2) = 19. Then, layer 3 has 18, but we need 26-19=7 more. So maybe 7 circles in a partial layer.\n\nBut how to arrange these in the square? Let me think of the positions.\n\nEach circle in layer k is placed at a distance of k * (2r) from the center, where r is the radius of the circles. But since the circles can have varying radii, this complicates things. However, assuming all circles have the same radius, the distance between centers would be 2r. But since the goal is to maximize the sum of radii, perhaps varying radii would allow for a better packing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a combination of layers with different radii. For example, the central circle is larger, then the surrounding ones are smaller, allowing for tighter packing.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me try to implement a more structured approach.\n\nLet me think of the following arrangement:\n\n- One central circle.\n- A first ring of 6 circles around it.\n- A second ring of 12 circles.\n- A third ring of 7 circles.\n\nTotal 1+6+12+7=26. Now, how to place these in the square.\n\nThe central circle is at (0.5, 0.5). The first ring of 6 circles would be placed at a distance of d1 from the center. The second ring at distance d2, and the third at d3. The positions need to be calculated such that they don't exceed the square's boundaries.\n\nBut how to determine d1, d2, d3? Also, the radii of the circles would be limited by the distance to their neighbors and to the square's edges.\n\nLet me try to calculate these distances.\n\nAssuming all circles have the same radius r, the distance between the center and the first ring would be 2r (since the circles touch each other). Similarly, the distance between the first and second ring would be 2r. The distance between the second and third ring would be 2r. But this is for equal radii. However, if the radii vary, this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that all circles have the same radius, then the positions can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor the first ring (6 circles), their centers are at a distance of 2r from the center. For the second ring (12 circles), the distance from the center would be 4r, since each subsequent layer adds another 2r. The third ring would be at 6r.\n\nNow, the maximum distance from the center to any circle's center is 6r. Since the square has side length 1, the distance from the center to the edge is 0.5. So, 6r + r (the radius of the outermost circle) must be \u2264 0.5. Wait, no. The distance from the center to the edge of the square is 0.5. The distance from the center to the center of the outermost circle is 6r. Then, the radius of that outer circle must be such that 6r + r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 7r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 r \u2264 0.5/7 \u2248 0.0714. That's very small. But this is assuming all circles have the same radius, which might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, if the outer circles have smaller radii, allowing the inner ones to have larger radii. This is the approach used in the AlphaEvolve paper, perhaps.\n\nBut how to model this in code without iterative optimization?\n\nThis is tricky. Another approach is to look for known optimal configurations for n=26. Since I can't look it up, I need to think of a plausible arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the current code's sum is 0.9598, which is way below the target of 2.635. This suggests that the current arrangement is very inefficient. Therefore, the main issue is the initial placement of circles, which is not optimal.\n\nLet me try to create a more efficient arrangement. For example, instead of placing 8 circles around the center, use a hexagonal ring of 6, then another ring of 12, and a third ring of 7, totaling 26. Let's try that.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the new construct_packing function:\n\n1. Place the central circle at (0.5, 0.5).\n2. Place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring. The distance from the center to each of these is d1.\n3. Place 12 circles in the next ring, with distance d2 from the center.\n4. Place 7 circles in the third ring, with distance d3 from the center.\n\nBut how to calculate d1, d2, d3 to ensure the circles fit within the square and don't overlap.\n\nAssuming all circles have the same radius r, then:\n\n- Between the central circle and the first ring: distance between centers is 2r (they touch).\n- Between the first ring and the second ring: distance between centers is 2r (they touch).\n- Between the second ring and the third ring: distance between centers is 2r.\n\nThe maximum distance from the center to the outermost circle's center is d3 + r (since the outer circle's radius is r). This must be \u2264 0.5 (distance from center to square edge). So:\n\nd3 + r \u2264 0.5\n\nAlso, d3 = 4r (since each ring adds 2r). So:\n\n4r + r = 5r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 r \u2264 0.1.\n\nThat's still\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its performance on the specified metrics.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```\n", "responses": ["<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the circle packing program for 26 circles in a unit square to maximize the sum of radii. The current sum is 0.9598, but the target is around 2.635 as mentioned in the AlphaEvolve paper. So there's a big gap here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the current approach isn't achieving that. The existing code places a central circle, then 8 around it, and 16 in an outer ring. But maybe this arrangement isn't optimal. The problem is that the current method uses a simple radial placement, which might not utilize space efficiently, especially near the edges.\n\nThe key insights from the user's notes are about hexagonal packing, edge effects, and varying radii. So maybe a more efficient pattern, like a hexagonal grid, would help. But with 26 circles, how to arrange them? Let's think about typical circle packing arrangements. \n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, each layer adds more circles. Maybe the current approach has too many circles in the outer ring, which might be too far from the center, leading to smaller radii because of proximity to the square's edges. \n\nAnother thing: the current code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which might be causing some circles to be too close to the edges, limiting their radii. Maybe adjusting the clipping or the initial positions can help.\n\nAlso, the compute_max_radii function scales radii proportionally when overlaps are detected. However, this is a greedy approach and might not find the optimal radii. Maybe there's a better way to compute the radii, perhaps using a more systematic method like solving a system of equations for the constraints, but that might be computationally intensive.\n\nWait, but the user wants an explicit constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to design a specific arrangement where each circle's position is determined analytically, then compute their radii based on distances to neighbors and edges.\n\nLet me think about a better arrangement. Maybe instead of a single central circle with two rings, use multiple layers. For example, a hexagonal packing with multiple concentric layers. Let's see how many circles that would take. \n\nIn a hexagonal packing, the number of circles in each layer is 6n, where n is the layer number. For example, layer 0 has 1, layer 1 has 6, layer 2 has 12, etc. So for 26 circles, maybe 1 (center) + 6 (first layer) + 12 (second layer) + 7 (some partial layer)? That might not add up. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking up known optimal packings for 26 circles. But since I can't look that up, I need to think of a plausible configuration.\n\nAnother idea: the existing code has 1 + 8 + 16 = 25 circles, but the code uses 26. Wait, the code initializes 26 circles. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, centers[0] is the center. Then, for i in 0-7 (8 circles), then for i in 0-15 (16 circles). So that's 1 + 8 + 16 = 25. Wait, but n is 26. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. The code initializes 26 centers, but the loops only fill 25. That's a problem. So in the current code, centers[0] is filled, then 1-8 (8 circles), then 9-24 (16 circles), making 1+8+16=25. So the 26th circle is left at [0,0], which is incorrect. That's a bug. That would definitely affect the sum of radii because one circle is at the origin with radius min(0, 0, 1-0, 1-0) = 0. So that's a mistake. The user's current code may have that error, which explains why the sum is low. So fixing that is a must.\n\nBut the user's current performance metrics show a sum_radii of 0.9598. So maybe that error isn't the main issue here, but it's a bug that needs fixing. So in the new code, I need to ensure all 26 circles are properly placed.\n\nSo, the first step is to correct the circle placement. Let me think of a better arrangement.\n\nAnother approach: use a hexagonal grid with some layers. For example, arrange circles in a hexagonal pattern with multiple rows. For 26 circles, maybe 5 rows with varying numbers of circles. But I need to think of a way to place them.\n\nAlternatively, look at the standard circle packing in a square. For example, for n=26, there might be a known configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of an arrangement that can be constructed manually.\n\nLet me consider that in the current code, the outer ring is placed at a radius of 0.7 from the center. However, since the square has sides of length 1, placing circles at 0.7 radius from the center might make them too close to the edges. For example, the center is at (0.5, 0.5). A circle placed at (0.5 + 0.7*cos(theta), 0.5 + 0.7*sin(theta)) would have coordinates that could be up to 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2, which is outside the square. Hence, the code clips them to 0.99, which reduces their radii. So maybe the outer ring's radius is too large, causing the clipping and reducing the possible radii.\n\nSo perhaps adjusting the positions of the outer circles to be closer to the center, allowing for larger radii without clipping.\n\nAnother idea: instead of placing circles in a single ring, maybe use multiple concentric rings with varying radii, ensuring that all circles are within the square and have sufficient space between them.\n\nAlternatively, use a more efficient pattern where circles are arranged in a hexagonal grid but adjusted to fit into the square. For example, arrange the circles in a grid with rows offset by half the circle diameter, but adjusted so that they fit within the square.\n\nBut how to translate that into code?\n\nAlternatively, look for existing known configurations. For example, in the literature, for n=26, the optimal packing might have a certain structure. However, without specific knowledge, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me think of a possible arrangement. Suppose we have a central circle, then a ring of 6 circles around it, then another ring of 12 circles, and maybe some more. Wait, 1 + 6 + 12 = 19. Then adding another 7 circles? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as divided into regions. For example, four corners with clusters, and some along the edges.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of layers. Let me try to think of a way to place 26 circles in a more optimal way.\n\nAnother approach: instead of using a fixed radius for each ring, calculate the positions based on the desired spacing. For example, if circles are placed in a hexagonal grid, the distance between centers should be at least twice the radius (assuming all circles have the same radius). However, since the radii might vary, this complicates things.\n\nBut the current code uses a compute_max_radii function which scales the radii based on the distances between centers. However, this might not be optimal because scaling is done pairwise, which could lead to suboptimal radii for some circles.\n\nSo, perhaps a better way is to design the positions in such a way that the minimal distance between any two centers is maximized, allowing for larger radii. This is essentially the circle packing problem where you want to maximize the minimum radius, but here the goal is to maximize the sum of radii, which may involve varying radii.\n\nBut since the user wants an explicit constructor, not an algorithm that iteratively optimizes, I need to come up with a specific arrangement.\n\nLet me consider that the current code's main issue is the inefficient placement of circles. For example, the outer ring is too far from the center, leading to clipping and thus smaller radii. Let me try to adjust that.\n\nLet me think of a different configuration. Suppose I have multiple concentric rings. For example, the first ring (center) has 1 circle, the second ring has 6, the third has 12, and the fourth has 7. That totals 1+6+12+7=26. But how to arrange them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more balanced approach. Let me try to create a structure where the circles are placed in a hexagonal pattern, with positions calculated such that they fit within the square and have sufficient spacing.\n\nFor example, for a hexagonal grid, each circle is placed at positions (i + 0.5*j, j*sqrt(3)/2), but adjusted to fit into the square. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use a more empirical approach. Let's say the current code has a central circle, 8 surrounding it (which is more than a hexagonal ring of 6), and then 16 in the outer ring. But maybe that's not optimal. Let's think of a better way to arrange 26 circles.\n\nAnother thought: the current code's outer ring has 16 circles. Placing 16 circles in a ring around the center would require them to be spaced every 22.5 degrees (since 360/16=22.5). But this might lead to a larger radius for the outer ring, causing clipping. Instead, perhaps using a smaller radius for the outer ring, allowing for larger radii.\n\nLet me try adjusting the code to place the outer ring at a smaller radius. For example, instead of 0.7, maybe 0.4 or 0.5. Let's see. The center is at (0.5, 0.5). If the outer ring is placed at a radius r from the center, then the maximum distance from the square's edge would be 0.5 - (0.5 + r) = 0.5 - (0.5 + r) = -r? Wait, no. The distance from the center to the edge is 0.5 units. So if a circle is placed at a distance d from the center, then its maximum radius is limited by the distance to the square's edge. For example, if the circle is at (0.5 + d*cos(theta), 0.5 + d*sin(theta)), then the distance to the nearest edge is min(0.5 - d*cos(theta), 0.5 - d*sin(theta), 0.5 - (1 - (0.5 + d*cos(theta)))), etc. This is getting complex, but perhaps placing the outer ring at a smaller radius would allow for larger radii.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial positions are not optimal. For example, the current code's outer ring is placed at 0.7 from the center, but that's too far. Let's try placing the outer ring at a smaller radius. Let's say 0.4. Then, the circles would be placed at 0.5 + 0.4*cos(theta), etc. Then, the distance from the square's edge would be 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1, which would limit the radius to 0.1. That's small, but maybe better than the current approach.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a more efficient arrangement where circles are closer together but with varying radii. For example, some circles near the edges can be smaller, allowing others in the center to be larger.\n\nBut how to model that in code?\n\nAnother idea: instead of having all circles in rings, use a more compact arrangement.

So maybe 7 circles in a partial layer.\n\nBut how to arrange these in the square? Let me think of the positions.\n\nEach circle in layer k is placed at a distance of k * (2r) from the center, where r is the radius of the circles. But since the circles can have varying radii, this complicates things. However, assuming all circles have the same radius, the distance between centers would be 2r.

The second ring at distance d2, and the third at d3. The positions need to be calculated such that they don't exceed the square's boundaries.\n\nBut how to determine d1, d2, d3?

The third ring would be at 6r.\n\nNow, the maximum distance from the center to any circle's center is 6r. Since the square has side length 1, the distance from the center to the edge is 0.5. So, 6r + r (the radius of the outermost circle) must be \u2264 0.5. Wait, no. The distance from the center to the edge of the square is 0.5. The distance from the center to the center of the outermost circle is 6r. Then, the radius of that outer circle must be such that 6r + r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 7r \u2264 0.5 \u2192 r \u2264 0.5/7 \u2248 0.0714. That's very small.
