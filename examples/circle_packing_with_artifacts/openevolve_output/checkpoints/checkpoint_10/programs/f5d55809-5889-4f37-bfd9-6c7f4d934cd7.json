{"id": "f5d55809-5889-4f37-bfd9-6c7f4d934cd7", "code": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the given Python program for circle packing with 26 circles in a unit square. The current sum of radii is 0.9598, but the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635. So there's a big gap here. But the user isn't asking for an optimization algorithm; they want a constructor function that directly produces the specific arrangement, not an iterative search.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the existing code. The current approach places one circle in the center, 8 around it in a ring, and 16 in an outer ring. Then it computes the maximum radii by clipping to the square borders and scaling radii to prevent overlaps. However, this approach might not be optimal because the initial placement is too simplistic.\n\nThe problem is that the current configuration is probably not dense enough. The sum of radii is way below the target. To improve this, I need to think about more efficient circle arrangements. Since the AlphaEvolve result is much higher, there must be a better configuration.\n\nLet me recall that in circle packing, hexagonal arrangements are more efficient. Maybe the existing code's layers are too spaced out. For example, the first ring of 8 circles is placed at radius 0.3 from the center, and the outer ring at 0.7. But perhaps these distances are too large, leading to smaller radii.\n\nAnother thought: the current code uses a fixed radius for each layer, but maybe varying radii could allow for better packing. Also, the initial positions might not account for edge effects properly. The code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, but maybe that's causing unnecessary constraints.\n\nWait, the main issue is that the initial positions are not optimized. The current code's approach is to manually place circles in rings, but without considering the optimal spacing between them. The compute_max_radii function then adjusts the radii, but if the initial positions are suboptimal, the radii will be limited by the distances between the centers.\n\nSo to maximize the sum of radii, the initial positions need to be as close as possible to each other, allowing for larger radii. But how to arrange 26 circles optimally?\n\nResearching circle packing in squares, I know that for n=26, there's a known optimal or near-optimal configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of a way to structure the circles in a more efficient pattern.\n\nPerhaps using multiple concentric layers. For example, a central circle, then layers around it. For 26 circles, maybe:\n\n- 1 center\n- 6 in the first ring (hexagonal)\n- 12 in the second ring\n- 7 in the third? Wait, that adds up to 1+6+12+7=26? No, 1+6+12+7=26? 1+6=7, 7+12=19, 19+7=26. That could be. But how to arrange them?\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having circles arranged in rows and columns. For example, 5 rows with 5 circles each (25) plus one more. But that might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, use a hexagonal packing pattern. For example, in a square, arrange circles in rows with offset positions. For example, rows with 5 circles, then 5, then 5, then 5, then 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 26 circles as being arranged in a hexagonal grid, but confined within the square. However, the exact positions would need careful calculation.\n\nBut the user wants a constructor function that directly places the circles, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to come up with a specific, hardcoded arrangement that's more efficient.\n\nAnother idea: the current code's outer ring is placed at radius 0.7 from the center. That's a distance of 0.7 from the center, so the distance between the center circle and the outer ring is 0.7. If the centers are placed closer, the radii could be larger. But then the circles would overlap.\n\nWait, the compute_max_radii function scales the radii based on the distance between centers. So if the initial centers are placed too close, the radii would be limited by that distance. But if they're placed optimally, the radii can be maximized.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing code's initial positions are too spread out, leading to small radii. For example, the first ring of 8 circles is placed at radius 0.3 from the center. Let's imagine that the distance between adjacent circles in that ring is 2*0.3*sin(\u03c0/8) \u2248 0.6*0.382 \u2248 0.229. But if those circles are placed closer together, the radii could be larger.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a known configuration. Since the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635, which is way higher than the current 0.95, there's a lot of room for improvement.\n\nWait, the current code's sum_radii is 0.9598. That's way below 2.635. That suggests that the current code is not even close to the optimal. So the problem is that the initial placement is very inefficient.\n\nLet me think of a better approach. For example, in a hexagonal packing, the circles are arranged in a grid where each circle has six neighbors. The distance between centers is 2r, leading to a density of \u03c0/(2*sqrt(3)) \u2248 0.9069. But in a square, edge effects reduce this.\n\nBut how to arrange 26 circles in a hexagonal pattern in a square? Let me think of the number of circles per layer.\n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, the first layer has 1 circle. The second layer has 6, the third has 12, the fourth 18, etc. But adding up to 26, maybe 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of a square with circles arranged in rows. For example, 5 rows with 5 circles each (25) plus one more. But that would be a square grid, which is less efficient than hexagonal.\n\nBut the problem is that I need to come up with specific coordinates for each of the 26 circles. Maybe I can use a hexagonal grid pattern, but adjust for the square's boundaries.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible configuration:\n\n- Place the circles in a hexagonal grid with as many rows as possible, adjusting the positions to fit within the square.\n\nFor example, with 5 rows. The first row has 5 circles, the next has 5, offset, then 5, then 5, then 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as a hexagonal grid with some circles on the edges.\n\nBut without knowing the exact optimal configuration, this is challenging. However, given that the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635, the sum of radii is much higher. So the current code's approach is way off.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the existing code uses a fixed radius for each ring, but that's leading to small radii. To improve, the initial positions should be placed as close as possible to each other, allowing the radii to be larger. But how?\n\nMaybe the problem is that the initial positions are not properly spaced. For example, the outer ring is placed at 0.7 from the center, which might be too far. If I can place the circles closer to the edges, their radii could be larger.\n\nWait, the compute_max_radii function clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which is to ensure they don't go outside the square. But if the centers are placed at 0.01, the maximum radius for that circle would be 0.01, which is very small. So placing circles too close to the edges reduces their radii.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial positions should be placed in the center regions, not too close to the edges. However, the current code's outer ring is at 0.7 from the center, which is 0.7 units from (0.5, 0.5), so the distance from the edge would be 1 - (0.5 + 0.7) = 1 - 1.2 = negative. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, no, the code uses 0.5 + 0.7*cos(angle), but cos(angle) ranges between -1 and 1. So when cos(angle) is 1, the x-coordinate is 0.5 + 0.7*1 = 1.2, which is outside the square. Hence, the code clips to 0.99. But that would make the circle's center at 0.99, so its radius can't be more than 0.01. That's a big problem.\n\nAh! That's a major flaw in the current code. The initial placement of the outer ring is at 0.7 from the center, but that leads to circles being placed outside the square. The code then clips them to 0.99, but that causes their maximum radii to be limited by the distance to the edge (which is 0.01), which is very small. Hence, the sum of radii is low.\n\nSo, the main problem is that the initial positions are not chosen such that the circles are close to the center and not near the edges. For example, placing the outer ring too far from the center causes the circles to be near the square's edges, limiting their radii.\n\nTherefore, to improve the sum of radii, the circles should be placed as close to the center as possible, avoiding the edges. That way, their radii are not limited by proximity to the square's boundaries.\n\nSo, how to arrange 26 circles in the square without being near the edges?\n\nMaybe using a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let's try to think of a configuration where the circles are packed tightly in the center, with layers that are spaced such that the distance from the centers to the square's edges is sufficient to allow larger radii.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a central circle, then layers around it. Let's say the first layer has 6 circles arranged around the center, then the second layer has 12 circles, and the third layer has 7 circles. That totals 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But how to place them?\n\nEach layer would be at a certain distance from the center. The distance between the centers of adjacent circles in the same layer should be twice the radius (assuming all circles have the same radius, but in reality, they might have different radii). But since the code uses a compute_max_radii function that scales the radii based on the distance between centers, perhaps varying the radii could help.\n\nBut the current code uses a fixed radius for each layer. However, if the initial positions are arranged more densely, the radii can be larger.\n\nLet me try to create a better initial configuration:\n\n- Place the central circle at (0.5, 0.5).\n- Place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring. The distance from the center to these circles should be such that they are not too close to the edges. Let's say they are placed at a distance of d from the center. The distance between the central circle and the surrounding ones would be d. The distance between adjacent surrounding circles would be 2*d*sin(\u03c0/6) = d*1 = d. So, for the surrounding circles to not overlap with each other, the distance between them must be at least twice their radius. However, since the radii are determined after the initial placement, this is handled by the compute_max_radii function.\n\nBut if I can place the surrounding circles closer to the center, their radii can be larger. However, they also need to be far enough from the square's edges to allow for larger radii.\n\nLet me try to calculate the maximum possible distance from the center for the surrounding circles. The center of the square is at (0.5, 0.5). The distance from the center to the edge is 0.5. So, if a circle is placed at a distance r from the center, its distance to the nearest edge is 0.5 - r. Therefore, its maximum possible radius is 0.5 - r. To maximize this, we want r as small as possible.\n\nBut if we place the surrounding circles closer to the center, the distance between them decreases, which would require scaling down their radii. So there's a trade-off.\n\nPerhaps the optimal initial positions are those where the circles are as close to each other as possible without being too close to the edges.\n\nThis seems like a complex optimization problem, but since the user wants a constructor that directly places the circles, not an iterative algorithm, I need to find a specific configuration.\n\nMaybe the AlphaEvolve paper's configuration uses a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let's try to approximate that.\n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, the first layer (center) has 1 circle. The second layer has 6 circles. The third layer has 12 circles. The fourth layer has 18 circles. For 26 circles, that would be 1 + 6 + 19 = 26? No, 1+6+12=19, then 7 more. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 26 circles are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with 5 layers. But I'm not sure of the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having circles arranged in rows. For example, 5 rows with 5 circles each, totaling 25, plus one more. But that's probably less efficient than a hexagonal arrangement.\n\nAnother idea: use a grid where each circle is spaced such that their centers are at positions (i*spacing + offset, j*spacing + offset), creating a grid. However, this is a square grid, which is less efficient than hexagonal.\n\nBut the user wants a specific constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to make an educated guess about the optimal configuration.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Place 1 circle in the center.\n- Place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring, at a certain distance from the center.\n- Place 12 circles in the next ring, at a larger distance.\n- Place 7 circles in an outer ring, but this might not add up. Alternatively, adjust the numbers.\n\nBut with 26 circles, 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. Let's proceed with that.\n\nFor the first ring (6 circles): placed at a distance r1 from the center.\n\nFor the second ring (12 circles): placed at a distance r2 from the center.\n\nFor the third ring (7 circles): placed at a distance r3 from the center.\n\nBut how to determine r1, r2, r3?\n\nThe distance between centers of adjacent circles in the first ring should be at least 2r (assuming all circles have the same radius r). But since the radii are determined by the compute_max_radii function, which scales based on distances, perhaps the initial positions can be placed closer, allowing for larger radii.\n\nAlternatively, since the code uses varying radii, maybe the central circle has a larger radius, and the surrounding ones have smaller ones. But the current code uses all circles with the same initial positions, then computes radii.\n\nBut the current code's initial positions are causing the circles to be near the edges, leading to small radii. To avoid that, I need to place the circles further from the edges.\n\nLet me try to adjust the initial positions:\n\n- Central circle at (0.5, 0.5).\n- First ring (6 circles) placed at a distance of 0.2 from the center. So their coordinates would be (0.5 + 0.2*cos(theta), 0.5 + 0.2*sin(theta)), where theta is 0, 60, 120, ..., 300 degrees. This would place them at a distance of 0.2 from the center, which is 0.2 away from the center, so their distance to the square's edge is 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3. So their maximum radius can be up to 0.3, assuming no other constraints.\n\nThen, the second ring (12 circles) placed at a distance of 0.4 from the center. Their distance to the edge is 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1, which is small, but maybe they can be placed in a way that avoids being too close to the edges. Alternatively, adjust the distance.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use a hexagonal packing where the circles are arranged in a way that their centers are as close as possible, and their distance to the edges is sufficient to allow larger radii.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the maximum sum of radii for 26 circles in a unit square is 2.635, which implies that the average radius is about 2.635 / 26 \u2248 0.1013. So each circle has a radius of around 0.1. That means the centers should be placed such that the distance between any two circles is at least 2*0.1 = 0.2. So the initial positions should be spaced at least 0.2 apart.\n\nLet's try to create a configuration where the circles are spaced about 0.2 units apart. For example, a hexagonal grid with spacing of 0.2 between centers.\n\nIn a hexagonal grid, the distance between rows is sqrt(3)/2 * spacing. So with spacing 0.2, the vertical distance between rows is sqrt(3)/2 * 0.2 \u2248 0.1732.\n\nNow, to fit as many circles as possible in the unit square, we can calculate how many rows and columns we can have.\n\nThe height of the square is 1. If the vertical spacing is 0.1732, then the number of rows would be floor(1 / 0.1732) \u2248 5.77, so 5 rows. The height needed for 5 rows would be 4 * 0.1732 \u2248 0.6928, which leaves room for more.\n\nSimilarly, the horizontal spacing is 0.2, so the number of columns would be floor(1 / 0.2) = 5 columns. So 5 rows and 5 columns, totaling 25 circles. Then adding one more circle somewhere, perhaps in the sixth row or column.\n\nBut this is just an example. However, the exact positions would need to be calculated.\n\nBut since I need to write a specific constructor, I'll proceed with this idea.\n\nLet's define a hexagonal grid with spacing", "language": "python", "parent_id": "75ee60f7-f9c7-411d-a557-dca2e9b6b595", "generation": 1, "timestamp": 1754261127.8109422, "iteration_found": 5, "metrics": {"validity": 0.0, "combined_score": 0.0, "llm_readability": 0.06999999999999999, "llm_maintainability": 0.06, "llm_efficiency": 0.05}, "complexity": 0.0, "diversity": 0.0, "metadata": {"changes": "Full rewrite", "parent_metrics": {"validity": 1.0, "sum_radii": 0.9597642169962064, "target_ratio": 0.36423689449571406, "combined_score": 0.36423689449571406, "eval_time": 1.6287438869476318, "llm_readability": 0.08000000000000002, "llm_maintainability": 0.06, "llm_efficiency": 0.06}, "island": 1}, "artifacts_json": "{\"stderr\": \"Stage 1 evaluation failed: Program execution failed: unterminated string literal (detected at line 2) (tmppnlyomw9.py, line 2)\", \"traceback\": \"Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \\\"/workspaces/openevolve/examples/circle_packing_with_artifacts/evaluator.py\\\", line 362, in evaluate_stage1\\n    centers, radii, sum_radii = run_with_timeout(program_path, timeout_seconds=600)\\n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n  File \\\"/workspaces/openevolve/examples/circle_packing_with_artifacts/evaluator.py\\\", line 172, in run_with_timeout\\n    raise RuntimeError(f\\\"Program execution failed: {results['error']}\\\")\\nRuntimeError: Program execution failed: unterminated string literal (detected at line 2) (tmppnlyomw9.py, line 2)\\n\", \"failure_stage\": \"stage1_execution\", \"suggestion\": \"Check basic syntax and imports before attempting full evaluation\", \"reasoning\": \"Readability is decent with clear variable names but lacks comments and could use better structure.

The user wants me to improve the given Python program for circle packing with 26 circles in a unit square. The current sum of radii is 0.9598, but the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635. So there's a big gap here. But the user isn't asking for an optimization algorithm; they want a constructor function that directly produces the specific arrangement, not an iterative search.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the existing code. The current approach places one circle in the center, 8 around it in a ring, and 16 in an outer ring. Then it computes the maximum radii by clipping to the square borders and scaling radii to prevent overlaps. However, this approach might not be optimal because the initial placement is too simplistic.\n\nThe problem is that the current configuration is probably not dense enough. The sum of radii is way below the target. To improve this, I need to think about more efficient circle arrangements. Since the AlphaEvolve result is much higher, there must be a better configuration.\n\nLet me recall that in circle packing, hexagonal arrangements are more efficient. Maybe the existing code's layers are too spaced out. For example, the first ring of 8 circles is placed at radius 0.3 from the center, and the outer ring at 0.7. But perhaps these distances are too large, leading to smaller radii.\n\nAnother thought: the current code uses a fixed radius for each layer, but maybe varying radii could allow for better packing. Also, the initial positions might not account for edge effects properly. The code clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, but maybe that's causing unnecessary constraints.\n\nWait, the main issue is that the initial positions are not optimized. The current code's approach is to manually place circles in rings, but without considering the optimal spacing between them. The compute_max_radii function then adjusts the radii, but if the initial positions are suboptimal, the radii will be limited by the distances between the centers.\n\nSo to maximize the sum of radii, the initial positions need to be as close as possible to each other, allowing for larger radii. But how to arrange 26 circles optimally?\n\nResearching circle packing in squares, I know that for n=26, there's a known optimal or near-optimal configuration. But since I can't look it up, I need to think of a way to structure the circles in a more efficient pattern.\n\nPerhaps using multiple concentric layers. For example, a central circle, then layers around it. For 26 circles, maybe:\n\n- 1 center\n- 6 in the first ring (hexagonal)\n- 12 in the second ring\n- 7 in the third? Wait, that adds up to 1+6+12+7=26? No, 1+6+12+7=26? 1+6=7, 7+12=19, 19+7=26. That could be. But how to arrange them?\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having circles arranged in rows and columns. For example, 5 rows with 5 circles each (25) plus one more. But that might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, use a hexagonal packing pattern. For example, in a square, arrange circles in rows with offset positions. For example, rows with 5 circles, then 5, then 5, then 5, then 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 26 circles as being arranged in a hexagonal grid, but confined within the square. However, the exact positions would need careful calculation.\n\nBut the user wants a constructor function that directly places the circles, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to come up with a specific, hardcoded arrangement that's more efficient.\n\nAnother idea: the current code's outer ring is placed at radius 0.7 from the center. That's a distance of 0.7 from the center, so the distance between the center circle and the outer ring is 0.7. If the centers are placed closer, the radii could be larger. But then the circles would overlap.\n\nWait, the compute_max_radii function scales the radii based on the distance between centers. So if the initial centers are placed too close, the radii would be limited by that distance. But if they're placed optimally, the radii can be maximized.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing code's initial positions are too spread out, leading to small radii. For example, the first ring of 8 circles is placed at radius 0.3 from the center. Let's imagine that the distance between adjacent circles in that ring is 2*0.3*sin(\u03c0/8) \u2248 0.6*0.382 \u2248 0.229. But if those circles are placed closer together, the radii could be larger.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a known configuration. Since the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635, which is way higher than the current 0.95, there's a lot of room for improvement.\n\nWait, the current code's sum_radii is 0.9598. That's way below 2.635. That suggests that the current code is not even close to the optimal. So the problem is that the initial placement is very inefficient.\n\nLet me think of a better approach. For example, in a hexagonal packing, the circles are arranged in a grid where each circle has six neighbors. The distance between centers is 2r, leading to a density of \u03c0/(2*sqrt(3)) \u2248 0.9069. But in a square, edge effects reduce this.\n\nBut how to arrange 26 circles in a hexagonal pattern in a square? Let me think of the number of circles per layer.\n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, the first layer has 1 circle. The second layer has 6, the third has 12, the fourth 18, etc. But adding up to 26, maybe 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of a square with circles arranged in rows. For example, 5 rows with 5 circles each (25) plus one more. But that would be a square grid, which is less efficient than hexagonal.\n\nBut the problem is that I need to come up with specific coordinates for each of the 26 circles. Maybe I can use a hexagonal grid pattern, but adjust for the square's boundaries.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible configuration:\n\n- Place the circles in a hexagonal grid with as many rows as possible, adjusting the positions to fit within the square.\n\nFor example, with 5 rows. The first row has 5 circles, the next has 5, offset, then 5, then 5, then 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as a hexagonal grid with some circles on the edges.\n\nBut without knowing the exact optimal configuration, this is challenging. However, given that the AlphaEvolve paper achieved 2.635, the sum of radii is much higher. So the current code's approach is way off.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the existing code uses a fixed radius for each ring, but that's leading to small radii. To improve, the initial positions should be placed as close as possible to each other, allowing the radii to be larger. But how?\n\nMaybe the problem is that the initial positions are not properly spaced. For example, the outer ring is placed at 0.7 from the center, which might be too far. If I can place the circles closer to the edges, their radii could be larger.\n\nWait, the compute_max_radii function clips the centers to 0.01 and 0.99, which is to ensure they don't go outside the square. But if the centers are placed at 0.01, the maximum radius for that circle would be 0.01, which is very small. So placing circles too close to the edges reduces their radii.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial positions should be placed in the center regions, not too close to the edges. However, the current code's outer ring is at 0.7 from the center, which is 0.7 units from (0.5, 0.5), so the distance from the edge would be 1 - (0.5 + 0.7) = 1 - 1.2 = negative. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, no, the code uses 0.5 + 0.7*cos(angle), but cos(angle) ranges between -1 and 1. So when cos(angle) is 1, the x-coordinate is 0.5 + 0.7*1 = 1.2, which is outside the square. Hence, the code clips to 0.99. But that would make the circle's center at 0.99, so its radius can't be more than 0.01. That's a big problem.\n\nAh! That's a major flaw in the current code. The initial placement of the outer ring is at 0.7 from the center, but that leads to circles being placed outside the square. The code then clips them to 0.99, but that causes their maximum radii to be limited by the distance to the edge (which is 0.01), which is very small. Hence, the sum of radii is low.\n\nSo, the main problem is that the initial positions are not chosen such that the circles are close to the center and not near the edges. For example, placing the outer ring too far from the center causes the circles to be near the square's edges, limiting their radii.\n\nTherefore, to improve the sum of radii, the circles should be placed as close to the center as possible, avoiding the edges. That way, their radii are not limited by proximity to the square's boundaries.\n\nSo, how to arrange 26 circles in the square without being near the edges?\n\nMaybe using a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let's try to think of a configuration where the circles are packed tightly in the center, with layers that are spaced such that the distance from the centers to the square's edges is sufficient to allow larger radii.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a central circle, then layers around it. Let's say the first layer has 6 circles arranged around the center, then the second layer has 12 circles, and the third layer has 7 circles. That totals 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. But how to place them?\n\nEach layer would be at a certain distance from the center. The distance between the centers of adjacent circles in the same layer should be twice the radius (assuming all circles have the same radius, but in reality, they might have different radii). But since the code uses a compute_max_radii function that scales the radii based on the distance between centers, perhaps varying the radii could help.\n\nBut the current code uses a fixed radius for each layer. However, if the initial positions are arranged more densely, the radii can be larger.\n\nLet me try to create a better initial configuration:\n\n- Place the central circle at (0.5, 0.5).\n- Place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring. The distance from the center to these circles should be such that they are not too close to the edges. Let's say they are placed at a distance of d from the center. The distance between the central circle and the surrounding ones would be d. The distance between adjacent surrounding circles would be 2*d*sin(\u03c0/6) = d*1 = d. So, for the surrounding circles to not overlap with each other, the distance between them must be at least twice their radius. However, since the radii are determined after the initial placement, this is handled by the compute_max_radii function.\n\nBut if I can place the surrounding circles closer to the center, their radii can be larger. However, they also need to be far enough from the square's edges to allow for larger radii.\n\nLet me try to calculate the maximum possible distance from the center for the surrounding circles. The center of the square is at (0.5, 0.5). The distance from the center to the edge is 0.5. So, if a circle is placed at a distance r from the center, its distance to the nearest edge is 0.5 - r. Therefore, its maximum possible radius is 0.5 - r. To maximize this, we want r as small as possible.\n\nBut if we place the surrounding circles closer to the center, the distance between them decreases, which would require scaling down their radii. So there's a trade-off.\n\nPerhaps the optimal initial positions are those where the circles are as close to each other as possible without being too close to the edges.\n\nThis seems like a complex optimization problem, but since the user wants a constructor that directly places the circles, not an iterative algorithm, I need to find a specific configuration.\n\nMaybe the AlphaEvolve paper's configuration uses a hexagonal packing with multiple layers. Let's try to approximate that.\n\nFor example, in a hexagonal packing, the first layer (center) has 1 circle. The second layer has 6 circles. The third layer has 12 circles. The fourth layer has 18 circles. For 26 circles, that would be 1 + 6 + 19 = 26? No, 1+6+12=19, then 7 more. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 26 circles are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with 5 layers. But I'm not sure of the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square as having circles arranged in rows. For example, 5 rows with 5 circles each, totaling 25, plus one more. But that's probably less efficient than a hexagonal arrangement.\n\nAnother idea: use a grid where each circle is spaced such that their centers are at positions (i*spacing + offset, j*spacing + offset), creating a grid. However, this is a square grid, which is less efficient than hexagonal.\n\nBut the user wants a specific constructor, not an iterative algorithm. So I need to make an educated guess about the optimal configuration.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Place 1 circle in the center.\n- Place 6 circles around it in a hexagonal ring, at a certain distance from the center.\n- Place 12 circles in the next ring, at a larger distance.\n- Place 7 circles in an outer ring, but this might not add up. Alternatively, adjust the numbers.\n\nBut with 26 circles, 1 + 6 + 12 + 7 = 26. Let's proceed with that.\n\nFor the first ring (6 circles): placed at a distance r1 from the center.\n\nFor the second ring (12 circles): placed at a distance r2 from the center.\n\nFor the third ring (7 circles): placed at a distance r3 from the center.\n\nBut how to determine r1, r2, r3?\n\nThe distance between centers of adjacent circles in the first ring should be at least 2r (assuming all circles have the same radius r). But since the radii are determined by the compute_max_radii function, which scales based on distances, perhaps the initial positions can be placed closer, allowing for larger radii.\n\nAlternatively, since the code uses varying radii, maybe the central circle has a larger radius, and the surrounding ones have smaller ones. But the current code uses all circles with the same initial positions, then computes radii.\n\nBut the current code's initial positions are causing the circles to be near the edges, leading to small radii. To avoid that, I need to place the circles further from the edges.\n\nLet me try to adjust the initial positions:\n\n- Central circle at (0.5, 0.5).\n- First ring (6 circles) placed at a distance of 0.2 from the center. So their coordinates would be (0.5 + 0.2*cos(theta), 0.5 + 0.2*sin(theta)), where theta is 0, 60, 120, ..., 300 degrees. This would place them at a distance of 0.2 from the center, which is 0.2 away from the center, so their distance to the square's edge is 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3. So their maximum radius can be up to 0.3, assuming no other constraints.\n\nThen, the second ring (12 circles) placed at a distance of 0.4 from the center. Their distance to the edge is 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1, which is small, but maybe they can be placed in a way that avoids being too close to the edges. Alternatively, adjust the distance.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use a hexagonal packing where the circles are arranged in a way that their centers are as close as possible, and their distance to the edges is sufficient to allow larger radii.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the maximum sum of radii for 26 circles in a unit square is 2.635, which implies that the average radius is about 2.635 / 26 \u2248 0.1013. So each circle has a radius of around 0.1. That means the centers should be placed such that the distance between any two circles is at least 2*0.1 = 0.2. So the initial positions should be spaced at least 0.2 apart.\n\nLet's try to create a configuration where the circles are spaced about 0.2 units apart. For example, a hexagonal grid with spacing of 0.2 between centers.\n\nIn a hexagonal grid, the distance between rows is sqrt(3)/2 * spacing. So with spacing 0.2, the vertical distance between rows is sqrt(3)/2 * 0.2 \u2248 0.1732.\n\nNow, to fit as many circles as possible in the unit square, we can calculate how many rows and columns we can have.\n\nThe height of the square is 1. If the vertical spacing is 0.1732, then the number of rows would be floor(1 / 0.1732) \u2248 5.77, so 5 rows. The height needed for 5 rows would be 4 * 0.1732 \u2248 0.6928, which leaves room for more.\n\nSimilarly, the horizontal spacing is 0.2, so the number of columns would be floor(1 / 0.2) = 5 columns. So 5 rows and 5 columns, totaling 25 circles. Then adding one more circle somewhere, perhaps in the sixth row or column.\n\nBut this is just an example. However, the exact positions would need to be calculated.\n\nBut since I need to write a specific constructor, I'll proceed with this idea.\n\nLet's define a hexagonal grid with spacing"]}}}
