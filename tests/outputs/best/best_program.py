"""
Circle Packing for n=26 Circles with Enhanced Efficiency and Clarity

This version leverages vectorized operations to eliminate nested loops in radius computation,
restructures the configuration logic for improved readability and modularity, and ensures
a cleaner separation of boundary constraint and overlap checks for better performance.
